                                <p>TERMINAL dates for the Smock Alley <hi>Henry VIII</hi>
                                        prompt-book (PB) may be set with some confidence as between
                                        1674/75 and 1682. John Totterdale, who is called for the
                                        role of the <hi>'third Gentleman'</hi> at IV.i.37, seems to
                                        have begun appearing on the Dublin stage in 1674 or 1675 but
                                        cannot be traced as acting in Dublin after "the early
                                        1680's." <note target="n1"> [1]</note> and a second actor,
                                        Henry Smith, who appears as Griffith in V.ii, died in Dublin
                                        in early August 1682.<note target="n2"> [2]</note> Three
                                        other actors are named: Andrews (as Brandon, I.i.161-164, as
                                        Gardiner, II.ii. 62, and as a <hi>'Gentleman'</hi>, III.i
                                        [opening, to enter at line 14]); Kaine (as the <hi>'Old
                                                Lady'</hi>, V.i.129);<note target="n3"> [3]</note>
                                        and 'Arstedt' (as a <!-- </page> -->
                                        <!-- <page n=18><ID>ShaHe8P18</ID> -->
                                        <hi>'Sergeant-at-Armes'</hi>, I.i.161-164 ). Of the first
                                        two actors nothing further is known, and the name of the
                                        third is almost illegible and resembles no name associated
                                        with Smock Alley at this time.<note target="n4"> [4]</note>

                                <p>Only two hands appear to have worked on the <hi>Henry VIII</hi>
                                        PB. Hand I, which is found also in the Smock Alley
                                                <hi>Hamlet</hi> (Hands I and II),<note target="n5">
                                                [5]</note>
                                        <hi>Macbeth</hi> (Hands I and II), <hi>Othello</hi> (Hand
                                        II), <hi>King Lear</hi> (Hand I), and <hi>I Henry I V</hi>
                                        (Hand II), is responsible for the advance character calls,
                                        for all but one of the actors' names, occasionally for
                                        changes in the original handling of a scene (e.g., II.i),
                                        and, I believe, for most of the initial cutting of the play.
                                        Hand II, which appears again in the Smock Alley <hi>King
                                                Lear</hi> (Hand II) and, perhaps, in <hi>Hamlet</hi>
                                        (Hand V), is associated with a number of verbal
                                        substitutions modernizing or simplifying Shakespeare's
                                        language, one character substitution (V.i.79), some revision
                                        of Hand I's scene arrangements (e.g., I.i.54-100; see
                                                <hi>Textual cuts</hi>), and probably one actor's
                                        name (II.ii.62). </p>
                                <p> The work of Hands I and II seems to represent different stages
                                        in the "production" of the play, but whether the play was
                                        ever produced in some form resembling Hand I's initial
                                        version must remain a question, even though Hand I's call
                                        for a particular actor (Totterdale) in a part of IV.i that
                                        was later cut would appear to suggest an earlier performance
                                        in which Totterdale acted the role of the <hi>'third
                                                Gentleman'</hi> (see <hi>Textual cuts</hi>). </p>
                                <p>One of the confused (and confusing) aspects of this promptbook is
                                        Hand I's apparently abandoned attempt to get rid of the
                                        character of Campeius. In II.ii, Hand I substitutes the
                                        Bishop of Lincoln; in II.iv he first gives Campeius' lines
                                        (64-68) to Lincoln and then restores Campeius, leaving
                                        Campeius' lines 121-24 untouched but assigning Campeius'
                                        speech at 230 to Wolsey; in III.i, he omits Campeius and
                                        either cuts his lines or assigns them to Wolsey, adjusting
                                        the dialogue to allow for the omission of Campeius through
                                        line 139, but abandoning such adjustment for the remainder
                                        of the scene. In each instance Campeius appears to have been
                                        restored: in II.ii by Hand II, in II.iv by Hand I, while in
                                        III.i Hand I's failure to carry through to the end of the
                                        scene his adjustment of the dialogue <!-- </page> -->
                                        <!-- <page  n=19> --> presumably indicates that he finally
                                        decided to retain Campeius. <note target="n6"> [6]</note>
                                        Since almost all the changes in II.ii and III.i made by Hand
                                        I to allow for the omission of Campeius remain uncanceled,
                                        the prompt-book, so far as these two scenes are concerned,
                                        is rendered seriously misleading if considered as a
                                        functionable prompt-book. </p>
                                <p> The <hi>Henry VIII</hi> PB is unusual in another respect. Except
                                        for <hi>The Comedy of Errors</hi> and <hi>The Winter's
                                                Tale</hi>, neither of which was, I believe, ever
                                        produced, it is the only other Smock Alley prompt-book that
                                        does not contain scene settings. This absence of scene
                                        notation may, perhaps, suggest that some kind of single set
                                        was used throughout, a manner of staging not impossible in
                                                <hi>Henry VIII</hi>, which calls for no very radical
                                        changes of scene. Curiously, the three earliest published
                                        theatre versions (1734, 1762, 1773; see below), like the
                                        Smock Alley prompt-book, are also without any indication of
                                        setting or scene changes. While, however, it is possible
                                        that the single-setting explanation may be arguable for this
                                        comparatively early Smock Alley production, the absence of
                                        specific scene notations in the eighteenth-century acting
                                        texts is almost certainly misleading, at least so far as
                                        London productions were concerned, since we know that when
                                        Sir William Davenant revived <hi>Henry VIII</hi> for the
                                        Duke's Company at the theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields in
                                        December of 1663 the play was rather lavishly presented,
                                        "being all new Cloath'd and new Scenes."<note target="n7">

                                <p>The <hi>Henry VIII</hi> PB is fairly heavily cut. The equivalent
                                        of 595 lines, a figure that includes the Prologue and
                                        Epilogue, are finally cut (46 lines originally cut being
                                        restored, mostly by Hand II), leaving a play of about 2,316
                                                lines.<note target="n8"> [8]</note> Compared,
                                        however, with the three eighteenth-century acting texts
                                        mentioned above and John Philip Kemble's early
                                        nineteenth-century acting version, the Smock Alley acting
                                        text is comparatively long: Powell (1734), roughly 2,078
                                        lines; Garrick ( 1762), 1,767 lines; Bell (1773), 1,733

                                        <!-- <page n=20><ID>ShaHe8P20</ID> --> The play, of course,
                                        makes much of its appeal through pageantry and show of
                                        various kinds, all of which consume precious stage time. It
                                        is therefore surprising that the <hi>Henry VIII</hi> PB, as
                                        in Davenant's earlier production, <note target="n10">

                                        that retains "The Vision" in IV.i. </p>
                                <p> The principal cuts are as follows: I.i.54-100 (conversation
                                        between Buckingham and Norfolk on the state of the kingdom
                                        and its relation to Cardinal Wolsey); I.iv.1-34 (chitchat
                                        preceding Wolsey's entry); II.i.1-54 (conversation of
                                                '<hi>two Gentlemen</hi>' about Buckingham's sentence
                                        and Wolsey's hand in it); II.i.136-169 (further comment from
                                        the '<hi>two Gentlemen</hi>'); II.iii.1-32 (conversation
                                        between Anne Bullen and an '<hi>Old Lady</hi>' on the
                                        desirability of being a queen [lines 33-49 were also
                                        originally cut but restored by Hand II]); IV.i. 1-117 (the
                                        lines of the three '<hi>Gentlemen</hi>' [i.e., all of the
                                        dialogue], leaving only the 'show' of 'The Order of the
                                        Coronation.'); V.i.1-55 (discussion between Gardiner and Sir

                                        Cromwell). A glance at the section on <hi>Textual cuts</hi>
                                        will show that, except for the second (I.iv.1-34), these
                                        cuts are closely reflected in the four acting texts referred
                                        to above. A similar closeness may frequently be observed in
                                        the shorter deletions as well. Such comparative continuity
                                        in the cutting of the play suggests a fairly unbroken acting
                                        tradition possibly stemming from Davenant's 1663 London
                                        revival; indeed, Downes claims that Thomas Betterton, who
                                        played the king, was specially instructed in the role by
                                        Davenant himself, "who had it from Old Mr. <hi>Lowen</hi>,
                                        that had his instructions from Mr. <hi>Shakespear</hi>

                                        is the Dublin publisher (1734) of a text that claims to
                                        present the play 'As it is acted . . . at the Theatres of
                                        London and Dublin.' Garrick refers to a version of the play
                                        prepared for production at Drury Lane and published in 1762
                                        (Garrick himself did not play in the production). Bell
                                        refers to the play as published by John Bell in Vol. IV
                                        (1773) of his edition of <hi>Shakespeare's Plays, As they

                                                  proceeded to do some further quite substantial
                                                  cutting, and crisscrossed many of Hand I's
                                                  originally deleted lines to make their omission
                                                  clearer. It is possible, however, that some other
                                                  hand did the initial cutting by circling the lines
                                                  to be deleted and that Hands I and II only revised
                                                  the cutting as this hypothetical third hand had
                                                  left it. I associate the crisscrossing of many of
                                                  the circled cuts with Hand II because restored
                                                  lines are only circled and never crisscrossed. For
                                                  example, in II.iii, where Hand I, originally
                                                  intending to retain lines 1-49 (as shown by the
                                                  position of the advance call for Anne Bullen and
                                                  the Lady placed at II.ii.117), changed his mind
                                                  and circled line 1-49 for deletion; Hand II then
                                                  restored lines 33 ('Nay, . . .)-49, placing 'Stet'
                                                  in the left margin but crisscrossing lines 1-33
                                                  ('... it.') to distinguish them as still being
                                                  deleted (compare the treatment of II.iv.18-34).
                                                  Occasionally, shorter deletions are made by
                                                  crossing through, but by what hand is uncertain.
