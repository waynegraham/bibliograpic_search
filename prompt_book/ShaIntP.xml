                <p>THE Padua <hi rend="italics">Macbeth</hi> prompt-book forms the first volume in a
                    series of seventeenth-century Shakespearean prompt-books to be published under
                    the auspices of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia. The
                    prompt-book is reproduced in collotype facsimile (reduced in size by 10 per
                    cent), accompanied by a critical Introduction and a complete collation and
                    description of all cuts, changes, prompt-calls, property notes, etc. and a
                    detailed comparison of these with later seventeenth- and eighteenth-century
                    acting versions. A General Introduction to the whole series prefaces this first
                    volume. </p>
                <p> Other plays to be issued in the same format will include the Padua <hi
                        rend="italics">Measure for Measure</hi>, the 'Nursery' <hi rend="italics"
                        >Comedy of Errors</hi>, and the Smock Alley <hi rend="italics">Hamlet</hi>,
                        <hi rend="italics">Macbeth</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Lear</hi>, <hi
                        rend="italics">Othello</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Henry VIII</hi>, <hi
                        rend="italics">Midsummer Night's Dream</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">Merry
                        Wives of Windsor</hi>. The remaining plays (see the General Introduction,
                    pp. 4-5) will, with two exceptions, be presented in a final volume, but without
                    facsimiles of the complete prompt-books. The exceptions, the Padua <hi
                        rend="italics">Winter's Tale</hi> and the 'Nursery' <hi rend="italics"
                        >Midsummer Night's Dream</hi>, will be included in earlier volumes in order
                    to complete the Dering and 'Nursery' groups. </p>
                <p> The following libraries have most kindly granted me permission to publish
                    special materials from their collections: the Folger Shakespeare Library,
                    Washington, D.C.; the Library of the University of Edinburgh, Scotland; the
                    Huntington Library, San Marino, California; and the Yale University Library, New
                    Haven, Connecticut. Further individual acknowledgement will be made as the
                    materials appear in the series. </p>
                <p>Many people have been helpful and unselfish in the preparation of this work, but
                    my gratitude is especially owing to Professor
                    <!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=2> --> Giordano Orsini for allowing me to trespass
                    on his pioneer work with the Padua First Folio prompt-books; to Dr. L. W. Sharp
                    for his kindness in waiving his first rights in the 'Nursery' and Smock Alley
                    prompt-books belonging to the University of Edinburgh Library; to my friends and
                    colleagues Professor T. W. Baldwin, Dr. Giles Dawson, Professor Harris Fletcher,
                    Professor Sears Jayne, Dr. J. G. McManaway, Professor R. W. Rogers, Professor
                    Arthur Sherbo, Dr. Allan Stevenson, Professor Jack Stillinger, and Professor
                    William Van Lennep, each of whom expended precious time in advice and criticism;
                    to Dr. Arthur Pennell who for four years served indefatigably as my research
                    assistant; and to Professor Fredson Bowers to whom I owe much both in form and
                    substance and through whose sympathetic interest these volumes have been brought
                    to press. It is with the deepest regret that I cannot once again, as always
                    before, thank my old teacher and friend, the late Professor Hyder E. Rollins. </p>
                <p> I should also like to thank Miss Eva Faye Benton, Miss Alma DeJordy, and Miss
                    Isabelle F. Grant, all of the University of Illinois Library, and Mr. C. P.
                    Finlayson of the University of Edinburgh Library. Particular thanks are also due
                    to the Research Board of the University of Illinois for continually generous
                    financial assistance and to the Board of Trustees for sabbatical leave granted
                    to me in 1956 to pursue my studies in England. Finally, I owe a special debt to
                    the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia for undertaking the
                    publication of my work in this form.</p>

                <head>General Introduction</head>

                <p>I am concerned in the present study with a comparatively small collection of
                    special Shakespeare materials: printed texts of Shakespeare's plays which give
                    evidence of a seventeenth-century theatrical provenience and thus record for us
                    some of the acting innovations, readings, and traditions current on the stage
                    during that period. In general, such texts may be described as prompt-books,
                    though I have included several acting versions which strictly do not fall into
                    this category. </p>
                <p>The complete study will afford a large body of detailed evidence about the text
                    of Shakespeare's plays as they were presented on the stage during the last
                    three-quarters of the seventeenth century. Since the time of Capell and Jennens
                    in the second half of the eighteenth century the textual guesses, sometimes
                    inspired and sometimes not, of a whole army of learned editors have been
                    reverently and meticulously recorded, an accumulation which resulted finally in
                    the Cambridge Shakespeare and the New Variorum of Furness and his successors.
                    Curiously, however, although there are numerous excellent general studies of
                    seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Shakespearean acting versions, both
                    published and manuscript, there is little detailed study or record of the actual
                    texts as such. For eighteenth-century printed theatre versions C. B. Hogan's
                    recent and invaluable <hi rend="italics">Shakespeare in the Theatre,
                        1701-1800</hi> (1952-57) must be noticed as an exception, though even Mr.
                    Hogan does not pretend to be complete in his lists of cuts and (particularly)
                    textual changes. This study, therefore, is an attempt, using special and
                    generally unavailable materials, partially to fill this gap in our knowledge of
                    Shakespeare in the theatre for the seventeenth century. It should be emphasized,
                    <!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=4> --> perhaps, that seventeenth-century printed
                    texts such as the 1681 <hi rend="italics">Othello</hi> or the 1676 <hi
                        rend="italics">Hamlet</hi>, which represent published acting texts, are
                    included only so far as they serve to illustrate the theatre prompt-book under
                    discussion. Since in this study I have aimed at a measure of completeness, every
                    effort has been made to establish the relationship between the
                    seventeenth-century and the principal eighteenth-century acting versions. In
                    order to do this it has been necessary to compare in detail each cut, textual
                    change, setting, etc. with its several seventeenth- and eighteenth-century
                    counterparts and to record the results in the notes to the collations and, more
                    generally, in the separate introductions to each play. Only in this way can the
                    uniqueness or community of a cut or reading in the seventeenth- and
                    eighteenth-century versions be recognized and a picture of the oral stage
                    tradition (for the text especially) begin to emerge. Nineteenth-century acting
                    versions, except for an occasional use of Mrs. Inchbald's <hi rend="italics"
                        >British Theatre</hi> (1808), I have considered outside the scope of the
                    present study. </p>
                <p>The materials may be divided into four groups. (I) Three pre-Restoration
                    prompt-books (<hi rend="italics">Macbeth</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Measure for
                        Measure</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Winter's Tale</hi>) which belong together,
                    being found in a copy of the First Folio now in the University Library at Padua,
                    and may be linked, as I shall try to show, with Sir Edward Dering of Surrenden
                    in Kent (<hi rend="italics">c.</hi> 1625-35). (II) Two prompt-books (<hi

                <p><hi rend="italics">Group I: Pre-Restoration prompt-books.</hi> The Padua
                    prompt-books, part of a First Folio in the University Library at Padua, have
                    been 'discovered' several times. Attention was first called to them by an
                    'Occasional Correspondent' in the <hi rend="italics">Scotsman</hi> (11 July
                    1895). Sir Sidney Lee then listed the Padua Folio in the Supplement to his
                    facsimile of the First Folio (Oxford, 1902) and described it as having "early
                    MS. notes, made apparently by an acting manager." It was not until 1932,
                    however, that anyone seems to have paid further attention; in that year G. N.
                    Giordano Orsini published an account of them as part of an article entitled
                    "Nuovi orientamenti della Filologia shakespeariana" in <hi rend="italics"
                        >Civilt&agrave; moderna</hi> (1932, IV, 3-46), an account which contained,
                    as an appendix, a nearly complete list of the textual deletions in the three
                    prompt-books. Giordano Orsini's study seems to have passed almost unnoticed in
                    this country.<note target="ShaGI1">[1]</note> In 1936, Leslie F. Casson,
                    apparently independently of Giordano Orsini's article, offered a general
                    discussion of all three prompt-books, noting the principal changes (and some of
                    the deletions), and made an attempt to date them by trying to associate the
                    actors' names and initials with particular actors in the Restoration.<note
                        target="ShaGI2">[2]</note> That Casson was mistaken in his identifications
                    will I think appear from the discussion below. Like Giordano Orsini's, Casson's
                    article passed unnoticed, except for a listing in <hi rend="italics">Studies in
                        Philology</hi>. Finally, in 1950, I 'discovered' the Padua prompt-books all
                    over again and was subsequently considerably chagrined to find that I had been
                    anticipated not once, but three times! </p>
                <p>It is not known how or when this copy of the First Folio
                    <!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=6> --> came into the hands of the University
                    Library at Padua. The volume was accidentally discovered about 1895 "amongst a
                    number of uncatalogued books".<note target="ShaGI3">[3]</note> My letter of
                    enquiry has received no response, and Casson, though on the spot, was unable to
                    uncover any further information. The book is bound in brown leather, almost
                    certainly its original English binding.<note target="ShaGI4">[4]</note> A label
                    which reads 'Tutte le Opere di: / Sakespear / Commedie e Tragedie. / manca il
                    Frontispizio' has been pasted on the inside of the front board (the front and
                    back end-papers, sig. A1, and the engraved title-page are lacking). The
                    handwriting is eighteenth-century, or possibly seventeenth, and suggests that
                    the volume arrived in Italy fairly early in its career. Below the label, in the
                    same hand, is written 'F in capsa / ad L&aelig;uam' (i.e., ?Folio in the
                    left-hand chest or drawer).<note target="ShaGI5">[5]</note> The number '385'
                    appears in the upper left corner. On sig. 3b6<hi rend="sup">v</hi> another hand
                    has written a phrase of which I can make no sense whatever: 'in /
                    &lt;Som.are&gt; content<hi rend="italics">um</hi>.'. The letters recorded for
                    the second word are very uncertain: 'S' might well be read as 'T', 'm' as 'ui'
                    or 'ni', etc.; and the form 'content<hi rend="italics">um</hi>' should perhaps
                    be read 'contentionem'. Below, on the same page, another hand has added what may
                    be a date 'M'y 6'. The inner back board contains what may possibly be either a
                    library number or acquisition date (?1695), perhaps both (see the reproduction
                    opposite page 4), and a scrawl in English, in yet another hand, beginning 'and
                    one y &lt;.n.&gt; &amp; &lt;ta.n.&gt; &lt;etc&gt;' (all but the first two words
                    badly smudged). Finally, we may notice what appears, when disentangled, to be
                    the name 'joh: B ffort' scribbled down the left margin of sig. F6<hi rend="sup"
                        >v</hi> in the prompt-book of <hi rend="italics">Measure for Measure</hi>. I
                    cannot associate the hand with that in the prompt-book or with any other in the
                    volume. <!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=7> -->
                </p>
                <p>The full importance of the Padua prompt-books has not hitherto been recognized;
                    they are, I believe, our earliest examples of Shakespearean prompt-books and
                    should be dated about 1625-35. The evidence for such dating must now be
                    considered in full. </p>
                <p>The Padua prompt-books contain no indication of location or scene setting.
                    Restoration prompt-books, except in unusual circumstances, regularly indicate
                    the set to be used with each change of scene.<note target="ShaGI6">[6]</note> In
                        <hi rend="italics">Macbeth</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Measure for
                        Measure</hi> the prompter's calls are not anticipatory (except in one or two
                    cases). This fact at once distinguishes these two Padua promptbooks from
                    Restoration prompt-books and in itself suggests a date in the later 1620's, for,
                    as W. J. Lawrence observes, " . . . so far as the prompter was concerned, the
                    system of advance calls for players, musicians, and properties first came into
                    vogue somewhere in the period 1625-31."<note target="ShaGI7">[7]</note>
                </p>
                <p>Other points also serve to support an early date. A 'Senett' is called for at the
                    opening of IV.iv in <hi rend="italics">Macbeth</hi>, where the Folio stage
                    direction makes no such provision. By 1660 the technical theatre term 'sennet'
                    seems to have been completely obsolete; indeed the <hi rend="italics">NED</hi>
                    records no later use than 1619. The <!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=8> --> calls
                    'Bee ready Group II:' (<hi rend="italics">Measure for Measure</hi>, IV.iii) and
                    'Bee ready' (V.i.259) are definitely on a pre-Restoration formula found
                    occasionally in prompt-books belonging to the second and third decades of the
                        century.<note target="ShaGI8">[8]</note> I have seen no cases of this
                    particular imperative warning in Restoration promptbooks. Again, the complete
                    absence of any attempt to 'modernize' Shakespeare's language immediately
                    distinguishes the Padua prompt-books from most Restoration acting versions,
                    particularly among the tragedies. There is also the evidence of the handwriting.
                    Two quite distinct hands are et work: Hand I, that in <hi rend="italics"
                        >Macbeth</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Measure for Measure</hi>;<note
                        target="ShaGI9">[9]</note> and Hand II, that in <hi rend="italics">The
                        Winter's Tale</hi>. Both hands give the impression of early rather than late
                    seventeenth-century formation, though this is a matter on which it is possible
                    to be badly misled. </p>
                <p>Finally, there is the important matter of provenience. Like a number of others,
                    the Padua prompt-books contain the names or initials of certain minor actors
                    among the prompt-calls, and it is possible, I believe, to identify three of
                    these individuals with persons who took part in an amateur performance of
                    Fletcher's <hi rend="italics">Spanish Curate</hi> produced by Sir Edward Dering
                    at his estate, Surrenden, in Kent, between 22 October 1622 (the date on which
                    the play was licensed) and "the summer of 1624".<note target="ShaGI10"
                        >[10]</note> Among the names listed by Sir Edward for <hi rend="italics">The
                        Spanish Curate</hi> are 'Jhon Carlile', 'Tho: Slender', and 'Mr. Kemp'.
                        <note target="ShaGI11">[11]</note> In the Padua <hi rend="italics"
                        >Macbeth</hi> we find 'M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Carlile' (and 'M<hi rend="sup"
                        >r</hi> Carl'), <!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=9> --> 'T S', and 'M<hi
                        rend="sup">r</hi> K'. The other three names which appear in <hi
                        rend="italics">Macbeth</hi> are 'M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> G', 'E H', and 'M<hi
                        rend="sup">r</hi> H&lt;e&gt;w&lt;it&gt;', none of which occurs in <hi
                        rend="italics">The Spanish Curate list.</hi> Trying to link these with Sir
                    Edward Dering is perhaps hazardous. I would, however, suggest that 'M<hi
                        rend="sup">r</hi> G' may be a certain 'Georg Perd' who figures in <hi
                        rend="italics">The Spanish Curate</hi> list and who knew Sir Edward well
                    enough to subscribe a letter with 'Thus in hast with my service to you<hi

                    unfortunately very questionable. Giordano Orsini reads 'H.wit'<note
                        target="ShaGI13">[13]</note> and Casson 'H&lt;ewi&gt;t', remarking, "This
                    name is difficult to decipher, but is possibly 'Mr. H&lt;ewi&gt;t'".<note
                        target="ShaGI14">[14]</note> I am fairly sure of two letters: 'H&lt;.>w&lt;.
                    .>'. There are two possible candidates. One is a certain 'Geo: Haule' or 'Cosen
                    Hawle' as Dering calls him.<note target="ShaGI15">[15]</note> The other is an
                    individual called 'Hugett', an acceptable spelling of 'Hewit'', who figures in a
                    long list of names at the end of Sir Edward's 'pocket-book' for the year
                        1637.<note target="ShaGI16">[16]</note>
                </p>
                <p>That Sir Edward Dering was interested in the theatre and in Shakespeare is
                    apparent from the telescoped version of <hi rend="italics">I</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italics">II Henry IV</hi> which is now generally known as the Dering
                    MS. This manuscript, the first page of which is in Dering's hand,<note
                        target="ShaGI17">[17]</note> contains numerous corrections and additions by
                    him. <!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=10> --> We also hear, in 1619, of nine
                    shillings spent for 'twenty-seven play-bookes'<note target="ShaGI18">[18]</note>
                    and, in 1637, eighteen years later, Dering was still buying more 'playbookes'.
                    In his pocket-book for that year a list of 'Bookes in print' begins with 'Duche
                    armes in print / Epitaphes. epithalamy's. playbookes / witchery.' and ends with
                    'Lat. Bible. Septuagint / Tertullian / Shakespeare / &lt;....&gt; &lt;....&gt;
                    painted / virgel and other poets of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> best / qu: de omni
                    modis biblijs / Lat Graec Anglic.'.<note target="ShaGI19">[19]</note> The exact
                    purpose of this list (mostly crossed through) is not clear, though it most
                    probably represents a collection of books sent to be bound and not necessarily
                    recent purchases. Dates of individual volumes range from 1573 to 1632, and the
                    'Shakespeare' so temptingly exhibited could be either a First or Second Folio. </p>
                <p>In setting out the evidence for the Dering provenience I have tried to avoid
                    pressing the claim too strongly. The case hangs essentially on one name and two
                    initials and cannot be considered conclusive. Nevertheless, it may, I think, be
                    admitted as at least persuasive, especially as the Dering provenience squares
                    perfectly with the other evidences of date already discussed. One point,
                    however, must now be noticed which may be considered to argue against attaching
                    the Padua prompt-books to the amateur Dering group. This is their apparently
                    professional appearance. In format they give the impression of having been
                    prepared by persons thoroughly familiar with the conventions of prompt-book
                    makers during the later 1620's and 1630's. It might be argued that Dering had
                    procured professional assistance in preparing these copies from
                    <!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=11> --> the official prompt-book, but this approach
                    seems to be ruled out by the fact that where an actor is named as playing one of
                    the minor roles, the hand is the same in both call and actor's name. Moreover
                    The Winter's Tale, which is cut only up to I.iii, assigns two small roles to 'T
                    S', showing that here at least the roles were assigned as the calls were written
                    in. Various solutions might be advanced, but none could be more than the merest
                    hypothesis. </p>
                <p>But even if we cannot argue very warmly for professional help with the actual
                    preparation of the prompt-books, the question remains of how far Dering's
                    changes, if we accept them as either his or changes made by one of his
                    associates, may be taken to reflect contemporary theatre practice. Considering
                    Dering's known interest in the drama, it seems fair to assume that in some part
                    at least the alterations may be taken to represent what Dering had seen on the
                    professional stage during his visits to London, and it is interesting to notice
                    how often the changes in <hi rend="italics">Macbeth</hi> are reflected in the
                    Restoration D'Avenant and Smock Alley versions. Such continuity suggests a
                    professional source, however come by, for some of the changes in the Padua <hi
                        rend="italics">Macbeth</hi>, and, by association, in the Padua <hi
                        rend="italics">Measure for Measure</hi> and <hi rend="italics">The Winter's
                        Tale</hi>. This last argument will hold, of course, even if we refuse to

                <p>The couplet from a Smock Alley production of <hi rend="italics">Julius

                    by Brutus, in the so-called D'Avenant-Dryden version of the play published in
                    1719 and that it seems likely that "the London alterations were known in the
                    Dublin theatre some years at least before they were available in print."<note
                        target="ShaGI30">[30]</note> This would seem to suggest that Bald does not
                    consider the possibility that the acting <!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=15> -->
                    list, which may be dated before 1677, and the hand that is responsible for the
                    couplet are contemporary (admittedly they are not the same). Though there is
                    nothing to prove that these two hands are contemporary, there is certainly
                    nothing to prove that they are not. Bald's caution is dictated, I suppose, by
                    Hazelton Spencer's rather categorical statement that the "limits <hi
                        rend="italics">of composition</hi> of this version [the D'Avenant-Dryden]
                    are thus 1691 and 1719."<note target="ShaGI31">[31]</note> But the arguments by
                    which Spencer reaches this conclusion do not seem to me entirely satisfactory,
                    and the appearance of this couplet possibly in connection with a production of
                    the play in the middle 1670's (before the appearance of the 1684 Betterton
                    quarto) at least opens up once again the whole question of D'Avenant's and
                    Dryden's possible implication in producing the 'improvement'.<note

                </p>
                <p>Our knowledge of the one-time existence of a Smock Alley prompt-book of <hi
                        rend="italics">II Henry IV</hi> we owe to S. W. Singer. In his attack on
                    Collier, <hi rend="italics">The Text of Shakespeare Vindicated</hi> (1853),
                    Singer describes (pp. vi-vii) a "tattered copy of the third folio edition of
                    Shakespeare" which "chance has furnished" him ('chance' here being presumably
                    Halliwell-Phillipps). He then gives a list of twelve plays with which he says
                    "the greatest liberties have been taken" in revising them for the stage. This
                    list includes, besides the lost <hi rend="italics">Julius Caesar</hi> and ten
                    plays now preserved in the Folger and at Edinburgh, <hi rend="italics">II Henry
                        IV</hi>.<note target="ShaGI33">[33]</note>
                </p>
                <p>Finally, the possibility that there were also Smock Alley
                    <!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=16> --> prompt-books of <hi rend="italics">Measure
                        for Measure</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Troilus and Cressida</hi>, and <hi
                        rend="italics">The Tempest</hi> was first brought to light by J. G.
                        McManaway.<note target="ShaGI34">[34]</note> He was able to trace
                    Halliwell-Phillipps' 'tattered copy' back to the library of John Dent. It was
                    sold at the sale of Dent's books in 1827. The auction catalogue carefully
                    describes the volume and offers four examples of the kind of manuscript
                    corrections it contained: one each from <hi rend="italics">Troilus and
                        Cressida</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Measure for Measure</hi> and two from
                        <hi rend="italics">The Tempest</hi>. Unfortunately the cataloguer was
                    interested only in textual emendations later suggested by either Rowe or Hanmer.
                    McManaway considers these readings as anticipations of Rowe and Hanmer and does
                    not believe it necessary to "postulate the intrusion of an otherwise unknown
                    literary hand" in these three plays in view of the fact that "the various hands
                    (Bald counts six in <hi rend="italics">Othello</hi>) in the Folger copies of the
                    plays appear to be connected with performances". But this is an
                    oversimplification of the state of some of the extant Smock Alley promptbooks.
                    In <hi rend="italics">King Lear</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Hamlet</hi>, <hi
                        rend="italics">Twelfth Night</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Midsummer Night's
                        Dream</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">Merry Wives</hi> it is certain that some
                    hand (described below as Hand H) about the middle of the eighteenth century
                    busied itself (with what purpose is not clear) with incorporating the readings
                    of various editors through at least Hanmer.<note target="ShaGI35">[35]</note> It
                    is also, I think, significant that Singer, who saw the volume before it was
                    broken up by Halliwell-Phillipps, did not include <hi rend="italics">Measure for
                        Measure</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Troilus and Cressida</hi>, or <hi
                        rend="italics">The Tempest</hi> among those plays "with which the greatest
                    liberties have been taken". In view of these considerations we must, I believe,
                    accept the one-time existence of actual theatre prompt-books of these plays with
                    some caution.<note target="ShaGI36">[36]</note>

                </p>
                <p>A particularly difficult problem in the study of the Smock Alley prompt-books
                    arises from the number of different prompt hands. Yet the identification and
                    isolation of these hands is most often the only clue to distinguishing the work
                    of different individuals in the preparation of a prompt-book. Several
                    prompt-books contain as many as five or six principal hands and it is frequently
                    hard, sometimes impossible, to assign to its proper hand each prompt-note or
                    textual change. The difficulty becomes even greater when, under changed
                    conditions imposed by new pens, ink, etc., one tries to identify hands in one
                    prompt-book with those appearing in other prompt-books. As in dealing with the
                    Padua and 'Nursery' prompt-books, I have assigned all readings to a particular
                    hand whenever possible, but with the Smock Alley prompt-books I have more
                    frequently been forced to question the exact identification or to admit defeat. </p>
                <p>Eight hands appear in more than one Smock Alley prompt-book. The following table
                    will help to establish their interrelationships:<note target="ShaGI37"

                </list>

                <p>This listing leaves two major hands, each of which, so far as I can determine,
                    appears in only a single prompt-book: Hand I in <hi rend="italics">Midsummer
                        Night's Dream</hi> and Hand I in <hi rend="italics">Comedy of Errors</hi>. </p>
                <p>Exact dates for the Smock Alley Shakespeare productions are unfortunately
                    impossible to arrive at. The presence of particular actors in certain of the
                    plays can be useful in setting date limits, but even such evidence may sometimes
                    be ambiguous, the addition of particular actors' names being possible at various
                    times after the first use of the prompt-book. With this warning, however, a few
                    tentative dates may be suggested. <hi rend="italics">Julius Caesar</hi>, as we
                    noticed above, can be dated before 1677 and not earlier than 1670; Jeremiah
                    Lisle, who played the Cobble,<note target="ShaGI38">[38]</note> was not with the
                    Smock Alley players before 1670 and died in 1681, and Richards, who played
                    Brutus, left for the London stage in the summer of 1676.<note target="ShaGI39"
                        >[39]</note> Both Lisle and Richards also appear in the Smock Alley <hi
                        rend="italics">Night-Walker</hi> cast (which thus also falls between 1670
                    and 1676) but they do not appear by name in any of the other Shakespearean
                    productions. This fact would seem to suggest that the other productions are
                    later, but again the nature of the evidence may be somewhat misleading. For both
                        <hi rend="italics">Julius Caesar</hi> and <hi rend="italics">The
                        Night-Walker</hi> we have more or less complete casts; for the other
                    Shakespearean plays we have only occasional names attached to minor roles.
                    Richards, then, or even Lisle, may well have taken part in some of these other
                    plays; the fact that their names do not occur may simply mean that they did not
                    happen to double in a small <!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=19> --> part (as Smith
                    probably did in <hi rend="italics">Macbeth</hi>, for example) and so were not
                    particularly singled out for mention by the prompter. Even with this proviso,
                    however, it still seems likely that the other Shakespeare productions may be
                    grouped after the <hi rend="italics">Julius Caesar</hi> cast. </p>
                <p>The appearance of Henry Smith, who died in August, 1682, in <hi rend="italics"
                        >Macbeth</hi> (Hand III) and <hi rend="italics">Henry VIII</hi> (Hand I)
                    affords us a definite terminal date for these two plays, and the fact that Smith
                    is the only actor there named who also appears in the <hi rend="italics">Julius
                        Caesar</hi> cast might be interpreted, always remembering the dangers
                    involved, as an indication of some lapse of time between these plays and the <hi
                        rend="italics">Julius Caesar</hi> production. It will be noted, however,
                    that Smith's name occurs in <hi rend="italics">Macbeth</hi> in Hand III and may
                    be related to a second state of the prompt-book; in other words the prompt-book
                    may represent an earlier production with which Smith had no connection, a
                    production of the play essentially unaffected by the influence of D'Avenant's
                    version, an influence clearly reflected in the work of Hand III. The presence of
                    Totterdale in both <hi rend="italics">Macbeth</hi> (Hand III) and <hi
                        rend="italics">Henry VIII</hi> (Hand I), though it links these plays with
                        <hi rend="italics">Othello</hi> (Hand V), does not help in fixing an earlier
                    date limit, since, though he is absent from the <hi rend="italics">Julius
                        Caesar</hi> cast, he is found in the contemporary, perhaps even earlier, <hi
                        rend="italics">Night-Walker</hi> cast. Clark<note target="ShaGI40"
                        >[40]</note> suggests a date between 1674 and 1682 for <hi rend="italics"
                        >Macbeth</hi>; I would, on the whole, favor the later rather than the
                    earlier limits of this period for both <hi rend="italics">Macbeth</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italics">Henry VIII</hi>. </p>
                <p><hi rend="italics">Othello</hi>, which gives us a greater number of actors' names
                    than any of the other plays, the <hi rend="italics">Julius Caesar</hi> cast
                    excepted, shares Walmesley (Hand V) with the <hi rend="italics">Julius
                        Caesar</hi> cast and Totterdale (Hand V), as I noticed above, with <hi
                        rend="italics">Macbeth</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Henry VIII</hi>. The
                    several new names (Trefusis, Freeman, Barnes, and Charles, all in Hand V)
                    suggest perhaps that we should place <hi rend="italics">Othello</hi> after <hi
                        rend="italics">Macbeth</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Henry VIII</hi>.
                    Unfortunately nothing is known about when any of these new names
                    <!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=20> --> first put in an appearance at Smock Alley,
                    though Freeman and Barnes figure in the Smock Alley cast of Wilson's <hi
                        rend="italics">Belphegor</hi>, a production which may be dated 1677-78 or
                        1682-83.<note target="ShaGI41">[41]</note> I would suggest 1680-82 as a
                    probable date for <hi rend="italics">Othello</hi>. </p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italics">Hamlet</hi> prompt-book mentions Trefusis and possibly
                    Williams (both Hand VI). If the '&lt;W&gt;illian' who played Laertes was indeed
                    the David Williams who figures in the <hi rend="italics">Julius Caesar</hi>
                    cast, we may claim a terminal date for this prompt-book in 1679, David Williams
                    having gone to London early in that year.<note target="ShaGI42">[42]</note> Nor
                    is the appearance here of Trefusis inconsistent with a date prior to 1679; we
                    know nothing of Trefusis' whereabouts before the early 1680's. An early limit
                    for the production is indicated by the strong influence throughout the text of
                    the 1676 actors' quarto of <hi rend="italics">Hamlet</hi>. Thus we may, though
                    with proper hesitation, suggest a date between 1676 and 1679 for the Smock Alley
                        <hi rend="italics">Hamlet</hi>. </p>
                <p>Although the Smock Alley <hi rend="italics">King Lear</hi> mentions no actors'
                    names, it is linked with the prompt-books already discussed by several prompt
                    hands and unquestionably belongs to the same general period. Since, however, it
                    gives evidence of influence from Tate's adaptation, it must be dated after 1681. </p>
                <p><hi rend="italics">I Henry IV</hi>, of which only a fragment remains, must
                    certainly have been produced at Smock Alley some years before 1685, at which
                    date Baker, who played Falstaff, was well received on the London stage for his
                    performance in that role. The only name mentioned in the surviving half-leaf is
                    that of Longmore. It occurs twice: once as 'Longmo' and once as '&lt;&gt;more'
                    in a hand which I have called Hand II. Hand II links this prompt-book with <hi
                        rend="italics">Hamlet</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Othello</hi>, <hi
                        rend="italics">Macbeth</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">Henry VIII</hi>. Clark
                    on the evidence here of Longmore's name associates him, probably correctly, with
                    Smock Alley before 1685, although any references we have to him as a Smock Alley
                    actor date from the 1690's.<note target="ShaGI43">[43]</note>
                    <!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=21> -->
                </p>
                <p>Using Baker's Falstaff again as an argument for dating, we may also place The <hi
                        rend="italics">Merry Wives</hi> prompt-book before 1685. Prompt hand links
                    with <hi rend="italics">Hamlet</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Othello</hi>, <hi
                        rend="italics">Macbeth</hi>, the <hi rend="italics">Julius Caesar</hi> cast,
                    and Wilson's <hi rend="italics">Belphegor</hi> also support a date in the late
                    '70's or early '80's. </p>
                <p>The Smock Alley <hi rend="italics">Twelfth Night</hi> also almost certainly
                    belongs to this same period. It contains no actors' names, but it is linked with
                        <hi rend="italics">Hamlet</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Lear</hi>, and <hi
                        rend="italics">Macbeth</hi> by a single prompt hand. </p>
                <p>Three Smock Alley prompt-books remain: <hi rend="italics">Comedy of Errors</hi>,
                        <hi rend="italics">Midsummer Night's Dream</hi>, and <hi rend="italics"
                        >Winter's Tale</hi>. None of them is strictly speaking a prompt-book and
                    none shows evidence of actual use in the theatre. <hi rend="italics">The
                        Winter's Tale</hi> is simply an unfinished cutting (to IV.iv.442) with no
                    markings of any kind except rough circling for suggested deletions. <hi
                        rend="italics">The Comedy of Errors</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Midsummer
                        Night's Dream</hi>, although they show signs of a good deal of careful
                    preparation, by heavy cutting and rewriting, contain no calls or other
                    prompter's notes. Nor can the reviser's hand in either be associated with any of
                    the revisers' or prompters' hands in the other Smock Alley prompt-books. </p>
                <p>Certain general characteristics of the Smock Alley promptbooks may be noticed
                    here. (1) The usual first step in preparing a play for the stage seems to have
                    been a rough preliminary cutting. Such a step may be seen in the Smock Alley <hi
                        rend="italics">Winter's Tale</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Midsummer Night's
                        Dream</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">Comedy of Errors</hi>, none of which, at
                    least in their present form, ever reached production; the remains of this
                    initial cutting are also clearly marked in the Smock Alley <hi rend="italics"
                        >Hamlet</hi>, and probably in <hi rend="italics">Macbeth</hi>. But even in
                    this initial step differences in approach must be pointed out. The reviser who
                    worked on <hi rend="italics">Winter's Tale</hi> did nothing except circle
                    passages for deletion (as did the first reviser, I believe, of <hi
                        rend="italics">Hamlet</hi>); the reviser of <hi rend="italics">Comedy of
                        Errors</hi>, and particularly the reviser of <hi rend="italics">Midsummer
                        Night's Dream</hi>, went much further, not only marking cuts but adding new
                    lines or rewriting speeches, and, in the case of <hi rend="italics">Midsummer
                        Night's Dream</hi>, including scene settings. (2) The
                    <!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=22> --> order of events after the initial cutting
                    of the play is difficult to determine. In some cases, the initial cutting was
                    subjected to a thorough revision (as in <hi rend="italics">Hamlet</hi> and
                    probably <hi rend="italics">Macbeth</hi>). One hand usually seems to be
                    responsible for the advance calls; another hand for the indication of scene
                    settings (though in <hi rend="italics">King Lear</hi> and <hi rend="italics"
                        >Merry Wives</hi> the same hand is responsible for both). The calls
                    themselves are regularly anticipative, though at no set number of lines in
                    advance. They are, moreover, by character name, not as in the 'Nursery' <hi
                        rend="italics">Comedy of Errors</hi>, for example, by actor's name. Where
                    actors' names occur in the Smock Alley prompt-books they are always associated
                    with the character name and they appear only in very minor roles, probably where
                    some confusion might arise from doubling. No calls are made at the beginning of
                    an act. (3) Advance calls for the act break ('Act ready') occur regularly, and
                    in <hi rend="italics">Othello</hi> the prompter's note 'ring' is used at the end
                    of the act to indicate the point at which the music should begin. (4) The symbol
                    <figure/> to indicate 'whistle for a change of scene' appears only in <hi
                        rend="italics">Othello</hi> (I.iii; II.i, iv; IV.i; V.ii) and in the <hi
                        rend="italics">I Henry IV</hi> fragment (II.ii).<note target="ShaGI44"
                        >[44]</note> The Smock Alley <hi rend="italics">Hamlet</hi> warns of a
                    change of scene by an advance call 'scean' about ten or twelve lines before a
                    change is necessary. (5) Point of entry is marked in three of the prompt-books
                    by a slanted and crossed line usually in the margin (<hi rend="italics"
                        >Hamlet</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Othello</hi>, <hi rend="italics">I Henry
                        IV</hi>); the same symbol is also used in the 'Nursery' <hi rend="italics"
                        >Comedy of Errors</hi>, the King's Company Sisters, and the unassigned <hi
                        rend="italics">Twelfth Night</hi> (mentioned in Group IV above). The
                    Shakespearean prompt-books do not use indications of the exact point from which
                    an actor enters, though such indications ('E.L.' = East Lower; 'W. up.' =West
                    Upper; 'W.L.'=West Lower; 'E upp'= East Upper) occur regularly in the
                    contemporary Smock Alley <hi rend="italics">Belphegor</hi> MS prompt-book.<note
                        target="ShaGI45">[45]</note> (6) Calls for special properties or sound
                    effects are usually in a hand (or hands) other than those responsible
                    <!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=23> --> for the scene notations and character
                    calls. The same is true of the sporadic appearance of actors' names; except in
                        <hi rend="italics">Henry VIII</hi>, they are in a different hand from that
                    appearing in the character call to which the name is attached. </p>
                <p>One of the most interesting aspects of the Smock Alley prompt-books is the record
                    they a: ford of the scenic resources of this company during the 1670's and early

                    (1955), pp. 74-75. The actor John Richards left Dublin in the summer of 1676 and
                    acted in London until the union of the companies in 1682. Jeremiah Lisle died in
                    July, 1681 (Allen Stevenson, "The Case of the Decapitated Cast," <hi
                        rend="italics">SQ</hi> [1955], VI, 285), and Henry Smith died in August,
                    1682 (Bald, pp. 371-372; Clark, p. 75).</note>

                    through. The 'M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>' has been inserted above the line in the

                <note id="ShaGI26">26. Such scant information as we possess about these actors has
                    been brought together by Bald, p. 372; Clark, pp. 72-77; Stevenson, pp.

                <note id="ShaGI27">27. The appearance of Smith helps to date at least one production
                    of these two plays before 2 August 1682, by which time Smith was dead (Bald, p.

                <note id="ShaGI29">29. Stevenson (p. 289) lists four reconstructed actors' names for

                        >v</hi>); close examination, however, reveals these to be part of a canceled
                    call for Falstaff, Bardolph, Nym, and Pistol. Clark (p. 77) also mentions
                    "Kaine, a gentleman in Henry VIII" as well as "Mr. Kaine, the Old Lady in <hi
                        rend="italics">Henry VIII</hi>." 'Mr. Kaine' seems to be the result of
                    Bald's inadvertent reference to the 'Kaine' in <hi rend="italics">Henry
                        VIII</hi> as a man (p. 373). Both Clark (p. 76) and Stevenson (p. 289) list

                    the other added lines found in the 1719 edition; in fact, it appears to be a
                    reprinting of the Folio text with no lines even marked for cutting.</note>

                    I called attention to the implication of an attribution on the first page of the

                    Dublin," <hi rend="italics">ELH</hi> [1946], XIII, 217) states categorically
                    that the Smock Alley version was the same as that later published in 1719 "as
                    the work of Davenant and Dryden". He believes, however, that D'Avenant, at
                    leaast, could not have had any hand in it since it belonged to the King's
                    Players until after his death.</note>

                    played the Soothsayer. The character of the Soothsayer, however, is not even
                    included in the Smock Alley <hi rend="italics">Julius Caesar</hi> cast.</note>
