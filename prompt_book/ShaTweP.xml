     <head> I: The Smock Alley Twelfth Night </head>
     <p>THE Smock Alley <hi>Twelfth Night</hi> prompt-book (PB) like the Smock Alley <hi>Merry Wives
       of Windsor</hi> and <hi>King Lear</hi>, contains no actors' names, but it is tied to other
      Smock Alley prompt-books (1) by inclusion in S. W. Singer's list of twelve plays in "a
      tattered copy of the third folio of Shakespeare," which showed abundant evidence of a
      theatrical provenience (i.e., the Smock Alley Third Folio [1663/64] before it was broken up by
       Halliwell-Phillipps);<note target="n1">[1]</note> (2) by the appearance of a prompt-hand
      (Hand I) that occurs in the Smock Alley <hi>Hamlet</hi> (Hands I and II; c. 1676-79),<note
       target="n2">[2]</note>
      <hi>Macbeth</hi> (Hands I and II; c. <!-- </page> -->
      <!-- <page n=60><ID>ShaTweP60</ID> --> 1674-82), <hi>Henry VIII</hi> (Hand I c. 1674/75-79),
       <hi>Othello</hi> (Hand II; c. 1677-78 or 1682-83), <hi>I Henry IV </hi>(Hand II; c. 1675-85)
       and<hi>King Lear</hi> (Hand I; ? after 1681). The presence of Hand I in these other plays,
      ranging in date from about 1674 to 1685, suggests that the Smock Alley <hi>Twelfth Night</hi>
      probably falls somewhere within the same general span. If we add to this the possibility that
      Francis Baker, who played Falstaff in <hi>I</hi> and <hi>2 Henry IV</hi>, also played Sir Toby
      Belch (Thomas Betterton played both roles in London), then at least a terminal date of 1685,
      the year in which Baker left Smock Alley to act with the United Company in London, may be set
      for the Smock Alley <hi>Twelfth Night</hi>. </p>
     <p>Hand I, the only prompt-hand in the Smock Alley prompt-book, is responsible for scene
      settings, stage properties (one call only), sound effects, advance character calls, stage
      directions altered or added (one of each), textual cuts (five only), and textual changes (one
      only). Hand I, however, makes no attempt to modernize syntax or language. A second hand (Hand
      II), an eighteenth-century hand that also appears in the Smock Alley <hi>Hamlet</hi> (Hand
      IV), <hi>King Lear</hi> (Hand III), <hi>Merry Wives of Windsor</hi> (Hand II), and
       <hi>Midsummer Night's Dream</hi> (Hand II), as usual emends the Third Folio text by inserting
      emendations proposed by editors from Rowe (1709) through Hanmer (1743). Only selective
      readings by Hand II are recorded in the Collations (see <hi>Textual changes</hi>). </p>
     <p> Like the Smock Alley <hi>Merry Wives</hi>, the Smock Alley <hi>Twelfth Night</hi> is very
      lightly cut (only 10 lines out of a total of 2,429).<note target="n3">[3]</note> Of its five
      cuts, two (I.ii.62; III.i.52-54) may have been made to remove "bawdry"; one (II.iv.87) because
      of an error in the Third Folio text that makes nonsense of the line; and two (II.iv.5-6;
      III.iv.290-292) because the passages concerned are not immediately clear in meaning. A few
      lines may possibly (though not, I think, probably) have been cut on Folio pages 265 and 266,
      where a substantial part (lower outer corner of sig. Z1) has been torn away, affecting the
      text as follows: III.i.59-99 ('bring a . . . own'), enough inner marginal text remaining to
      rule out <!-- </page> -->
      <!-- <page n=61><ID>ShaTweP61</ID> --> any cuts; III.i.124-163 ('Myself . . . pride,');
      III.ii.6-50 ('<hi>And</hi>. Marry I . . . although the'); III.ii.76-III.iii.18 ('ever believe
      . . . firm,'), enough outer marginal text remaining to rule out any cuts. </p>
     <p> The Smock Alley <hi>Twelfth Night</hi> has been compared throughout with the following
      theatre texts (the first possibly earlier than the Smock Alley PB): Folger Second Folio
       <hi>Twelfth Night</hi> cuts about 36 lines; (2) Douai MS <hi>Twelfth Night</hi> (1694), cuts
      about 266 lines; (3) <hi>Twelfth Night</hi> in John Bell's <hi>Shakespeare's Plays, As they
       are now performed at the Theatres Royal in London</hi>, Vol. V (1773), cuts about 235 lines;
      (4) John Philip Kemble's Covent Garden <hi>Twelfth Night</hi> (n.d., about 1811), cuts about
      the same number of lines as in (3), but individual cuts differ.<note target="n4">[4]</note>
      The so-called Collier MS has also been consulted. </p>
     <p> The scene settings are stock (occurring in other Smock Alley prompt-books) and are limited
      to three: 'Presence' (used once), 'Towne' (used three times), and 'Court' (used or implied
      thirteen times). The last two are the most frequently used among Smock Alley settings;
      'Presence' appears elsewhere only in <hi>Othello</hi>.<note target="n5">[5]</note> Obviously,
      it was not intended to mount <hi>Twelfth Night</hi> with any unnecessary expense. </p>
     <p> Because both the Smock Alley <hi>Twelfth Night</hi> and <hi>Merry Wives</hi>
      <note target="n6">[6]</note> are, comparatively, so lightly cut, it is tempting to think that
      they may represent first steps in the preparation of the final prompt-books and that some hand
      other than the main prompt hand (Hand I in both) was expected to go over the play again with
      an eye to more substantial cutting. Against such a view, however, except for the lack of
      significant cutting, both are quite adequate to serve as actual prompt-books. Moreover, the
      comparatively small amount of cutting (c. 36 lines) in the Folger Second Folio <hi>Twelfth
       Night</hi> PB, of uncertain date and possibly earlier than the Smock Alley <hi>Twelfth
       Night</hi>, suggests that <hi>Twelfth Night</hi> at least, if not Merry Wives, was not
      considered as a play demanding much shortening. Finally, the length of both plays after
      cutting (Smock Alley <hi>Twelfth Night</hi>, c. 2,419 lines; Folger Second Folio <hi>Twelfth
       Night</hi>, c. 2,393 lines; <hi>Merry </hi>
      <!-- </page> -->
      <!-- <page n=62><ID>ShaTweP62</ID> -->
      <hi>Wives</hi>, c. 2,582 lines) is considerably less than the Smock Alley acting texts of
       <hi>Hamlet</hi> (c. 2,860 lines) and <hi>Othello</hi> (c. 2,808 lines). </p>

     <head> II: The Folger Second Folio Twelfth Night </head>
     <p>The Folger Second Folio <hi>Twelfth Night</hi> (hereafter Folger F2 PB) has no connection,
      so far as I know, with Smock Alley and is of unknown provenience. Like the Smock Alley
      prompt-books, however, it also belonged at one time to Halliwell-Phillipps, who describes it
      in his <hi>Some Account of the Antiquities, . . . In the Possession of James Orchard
       Halliwell, Esq.</hi> F.R.S. (1852).<note target="n7">[7]</note> Of its history before 1852,
      however, nothing is known, although it seems probable that it has a London (or English
      provincial) rather than a Dublin origin. Whatever its provenience, Folger F2 PB was never
      completed: all prompt notations cease after IV.ii, thus ruling out its use as a workable
      prompt-book. </p>
     <p> The absence of any scene settings in Folger F2 PB suggests a question. Does this indicate,
      perhaps, that this prompt-book should be dated some time before 1660, after which changeable
      scenery became common in the public theatres? One characteristic of this prompt-book, however,
      suggests that it is more probably post-Restoration: the marking of the point of entry for a
      character by a horizontally slanted and crossed line, an entry signal often appearing in
      Restoration prompt-books,<note target="n8">[8]</note> but not, to my knowledge, found in
      earlier prompt-books. </p>
     <p> A single prompt-hand worked on the Folger F2 PB, which, <!-- </page> -->
      <!-- <page n=63><ID>ShaTweP63</ID> --> though it is the only prompt-hand, I have called Hand
      I. It has some superficial points of likeness with Hand I in the Smock Alley <hi>Twelfth
       Night</hi> PB, but it is, I am sure, a different hand, and one that does not appear elsewhere
      in other Smock Alley prompt-books. Hand I is responsible for the act notations, calls for
      sound effects, advance character calls, Folio stage directions altered or added, textual cuts,
      and textual changes. It also, with some consistency, marks points of entry with a horizontally
      slanted and crossed line (see note 8), usually placed in the right or left margin. </p>
     <p> The Folger F2 PB has been very lightly cut (c. 36 lines, leaving a play of c. 2,393 lines),
      though slightly more heavily cut than the Smock Alley <hi>Twelfth Night</hi>. Of its four
      cuts, two (II.iii.39-47, 115-121) shorten or cut song lyrics, and two get rid of dated
      references to 'the old Hermit of <hi>Prage</hi>' and 'King <hi>Gorbodacke</hi>' (IV.ii.13-23)
      and to 'the old vice' with his 'Dagger of Lath' (IV.ii.133-141). There is no agreement between
      these cuts and those in the Smock Alley PB, further evidence, aside from Hand I,
      disassociating the Folger F2 PB from a possible Smock Alley provenience. </p>
     <p> The Folger F2 PB has been compared throughout with the same theatre texts listed above for
      the Smock Alley <hi>Twelfth Night</hi>. </p>
     <note id="n7"> 7. P. 115, Item 91: "The Play of Twelfth Night, from the edition of 1632, a
      play-house copy of about the date 1640, with the names of the characters in the place where
      they were to be in readiness to take their parts etc. fol[io]. This volume is extremely
      interesting, as showing the plan of an early performance of the play. It is curious to observe
      how little is omitted from the original text. The places for 'Musicke' are noted. Instead of
      the song at the end of Act iv, Sc. 2, we have only the following lines, I am gone, Sir, and,
      anon, Sir / Ile be with you againe, sir." Halliwell-Phillipps fails to note that this PB was
      never completed, and the date, "about 1640," is presumably only his best guess. </note>

      IV; almost entirely cropped); IV.iii (opening) (for Act v); V.i.270 (for end of Act V; almost

     <head> Advance character calls </head>
     <p>In the Smock Alley PB all advance character calls are in Hand I. There are no advance calls
      for characters entering at the beginning of an act. Because of the severe damage to F pp. 265
      and 266, advance calls are missing for III.ii (opening) and for Maria's entry after III.ii.69.
      The advance call for Maria at V.i.80 omits the '<hi>attendants</hi>' called for by the F s.d.
      after 99. </p>
     <p>In the Folger F2 PB all advance character calls are in Hand I, and the point at which a
      character enters is, usually, marked by a horizontally slanted crossed line, even for
      characters entering at the beginning of a scene, except for the first scene of an act, where,
      also, there are no advance calls for characters there entering. </p>

      in the F s.d. at V.i.99 in the advance call for Olivia at V.i.80. </p>
     <p> In the Folger F2 PB Hand I makes the following changes from F2 in entry s.dd.: II.v.204,
      Maria's entry is dropped from after 204 to after 205 (so Capell; Kemble drops to after 206);
      III.ii.69, Maria's entry is dropped from after 69 to after 71 (so Kemble); III.i.155, Sir
      Andrew's entry is dropped from after 155 to after 156 (so Kemble). Hand I places a cross in
      right margin at III.i.107, perhaps to indicate an exit for Sir Toby, Sir Andrew' and Maria
      (not in F2; first given by Rowe). </p>

       obscuring the F text, but only in this instance does Hand I make any attempt to bridge the
