    <head> Smock Alley <lb/><hi>The Comedy of Errors</hi>
     <lb/>Third Folio <lb/>Introduction </head>


    <p>THE Smock Alley <hi>Comedy of Errors</hi>, like the Smock Alley <hi>Midsummer Night's
      Dream</hi> and <hi>The Winter's Tale</hi>, strictly considered, is not a prompt-book. It
     contains no scene settings, actors' names, advance character calls, calls for stage properties
     or sound effects, and act notations.<note target="n1">[1]</note> What it offers is a text of
     the play as it appears in the Third Folio (1663/ 64) fairly heavily cut for acting, possibly,
     as R. C. Bald has suggested, to be presented as an afterpiece.<note target="n2">[2]</note>
    </p>
    <p>If we accept Bald's suggestion, the <hi>Errors</hi> PB should most probably be dated sometime
     after 1700, since before that date afterpieces were rarely included as part of an evening at
     the theatre.<note target="n3">[3]</note> Though considerably cut the <hi>Errors</hi> PB is
     still somewhat <!-- </page> -->
     <!-- <page n=74><ID>Sha8CEP74</ID> --> too long (about 1,215 lines) for the average
      afterpiece,<note target="n4">[4]</note> and such external and internal evidence as the
     prompt-book affords, admittedly slender, suggests that it was probably prepared at Smock Alley
     sometime before 1700. It was, we know, part of the same copy of the Third Folio in which the
     seventeenth-century Smock Alley prompt-books were prepared before that volume was finally
     broken up by Halliwell-Phillipps around the middle of the nineteenth century.<note target="n5"
      >[5]</note> This common provenience, though suggestive, proves nothing, of course, so far as
     dating is concerned. Internal evidence in the <hi>Errors</hi> PB depends entirely on an
     analysis of the revising hands responsible for the cutting. </p>
    <p>The <hi>Errors</hi> PB contains one main revising hand (Hand I). Hand I is responsible, I
     believe, for most of the cutting, a few changes in the Folio stage directions, all but possibly
     three of the linking bits of added dialogue, and probably the greater number of the single word
     substitutions. So far as I am able to judge, Hand I occurs nowhere else in the Smock Alley
     prompt-books and so offers no relatively datable link with other Smock Alley prompt-hands. What
     appears to be a second hand (Hand II) is found most clearly in a number of 'stet' notations
     (see I.i.99-109; III.i.86-106; III.ii.33-40; V.i.52-54, 58, 61), notations that are noticeably
     and consistently different from Hand I's 'stet' notations.<note target="n6">[6]</note> Besides
     restoring some of Hand I's cuts, Hand II is probably responsible for some of the single word
     substitutions and perhaps for three of the linking tags (see I.i.65-78, 88-95; III.i.108-114).
     Hand II may be the same as Hand II in the Smock Alley <hi>Henry VIII</hi> (see 'stet' at
     I.iv.37-38; II.ii.97-107; II.iv.38), a hand that also appears in the Smock Alley <hi>Lear</hi>
     (Hand II) and perhaps as Hand V in the Smock Alley <hi>Hamlet</hi>. <!-- </page> -->
     <!-- <page n=75><ID>Sha8CEP75</ID> --> Whether, however, Hand II's work as a whole, apart from
     the use of 'stet', in <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Henry VIII</hi>, is indeed by the same hand, it
     is, I think, nearly certain that at least the 'stet' notations, associated above with Hand II
     in both plays, are by the same hand, in themselves representing possibly a third hand common to
     both prompt-books. This 'stet' link, then, between <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Henry VIII</hi>,
     since the <hi>Henry VIII</hi> PB can be dated as not later than 1682,<note target="n7"
      >[7]</note> suggests (though does not prove) a seventeenth-century provenience for the Smock
     Alley <hi>Errors</hi>. </p>
    <p>Already the shortest of Shakespeare's plays (1,753 lines),<note target="n8">[8]</note> the
     Third Folio text of <hi>Errors</hi> has been cut by about 538 lines (a figure including
     half-lines), leaving a play of about 1,215 lines. The principal cuts (of 10 lines or more) are:
     I.i.65-78; II.i.8-42, 88-111; II.ii.26-40, 65-111, 32-148, 172-182; III.i.87- 97; III.ii.45-58,
     159-169; IV.iii.16-35; V.i.75-84, 92-108, 138-154, 231-253, 397-406. Adriana's role is
     proportionately the most heavily cut, and the character of Balthazar has been omitted, his
     lines, when uncut, being spoken by Angelo. In addition to his omission of Balthazar, Hand I
     makes two other, apparently quite senseless, rearrangements. The first occurs in III.ii, where
     Hand I decides to make Antipholus of Syracuse exit with Luciana at line 70, thus clearing the
      stage.<note target="n9">[9]</note> He then begins a new scene and, following line 70, brings
     Dromio of Syracuse and Antipholus of Ephesus on together, these two carrying on the dialogue
     describing Luce the kitchen maid through line 151, at which point, realizing that only
     Antipholus of Syracuse could take part in the following exchange with Dromio of Syracuse, he
     exits Antipholus of Ephesus, after a new two-line speech (only partly legible), and enters
     Antipholus of Syracuse. As a result of this rearrangement, Dromio of Syracuse's farcically
     exaggerated description of Luce loses all point when addressed to Antipholus of Ephesus, who,
     as her master, must already know her. The second alteration is much slighter but equally
     difficult to understand. Near the end of V.i, at line 414, the first two lines of Dromio of
     Syracuse's speech are assigned, again by Hand I, to Dromio of Ephesus, and the third line (416)
     is reassigned to Dromio of Syracuse. So far as I can see, this <!-- </page> -->
     <!-- <page n=76><ID>Sha8CEP76</ID> --> redistribution of the dialogue makes nonsense, and I can
     only suppose that here (as in III.ii) Hand I has fallen victim to his own comedy of errors. </p>
    <p>The confused nature of Hand I's alterations and the absence of the other stigmata
     characteristic of a prompt-book make it clear, of course, that the Smock Alley <hi>Errors</hi>
     could never have served as a prompt-book unlike the probably somewhat earlier 'Nursery'
      <hi>Errors</hi>, which was produced not later than 1677.<note target="n10">[10]</note> Had the
     Smock Alley <hi>Errors</hi> been produced, however, it would probably have been very similar to
     the version that emerged under Hands I and II (with Hand I's unhappy alterations ironed out).
     Together the 'Nursery' PB and the Smock Alley <hi>Errors</hi> extend our knowledge of the
     acting tradition by nearly a hundred years, the first post-Restoration performance of the play
     of which we possess an acting text being Thomas Hull's adaptation (acted 1762, privately
     printed 1770, revised edition 1793).<note target="n11">[11]</note>
    </p>
    <p>The cuts and other changes in the Smock Alley <hi>Errors</hi> PB have been compared
     throughout (see Collations) with: (1) the 'Nursery' <hi>Comedy of Errors</hi> PB (not later
     than 1677; about 1,375 lines), (2) Thomas Hull's 1793 revised adaptation of <hi>The Comedy of
      Errors</hi> (about 1,544 lines); (3) <hi>The Comedy of Errors</hi> (about 1,565 lines), edited
     by Francis Gentleman in Vol. VIII, 1774, of John Bell's <hi>Shakespeare's Plays, As they were
      performed at the Theatres Royal in London</hi> (Gentleman only suggests cuts but claims no
     authority for them as representing performance at either Drury Lane or Covent Garden); (4)
      <hi>The Comedy of Errors</hi> in Mrs. Inchbald's <hi>British Theatre</hi>, Vol. I (1808),
     essentially Hull's adaptation (see Collations); (5) John Philip Kemble's acting text (1815) of
      <hi>The Comedy of Errors</hi> (essentially the same as Inchbald; see Collations). Occasional
     reference is made to the Douai MS of <hi>The Comedy of Errors</hi> (l694);<note target="n12"
      >[12]</note> the so-called Collier MS; and William Woods' <hi>The Twins, or Which Is
      Which</hi> (1780; see note 4). </p>
    <note id="n1"> 1. The Smock Alley <hi>Errors</hi> will be referred to by the abbreviation PB. It
     is worth noting, perhaps, that the Smock Alley <hi>Midsummer Night's Dream</hi>, though only an
     unacted cutting like the <hi>Errors</hi> PB, includes scene settings (see Vol. VII of this
     series). It is possible, therefore, that the absence of scene settings in <hi>Errors</hi>
     reflects the revisers' intention to use a single setting for the whole play (see Introduction
     to the Smock Alley <hi>Henry VIII</hi> PB, p. 19). Capell first introduced a single setting
     ('Ephesus. <hi>A publick Place</hi>.') and is followed by Gentleman (see below); Hull,
     Inchbald, and Kemble (see below) introduce a number of scene changes, following Pope. </note>

     form of 'stet' (lower case 's', italic 'e', both 't's crossed) and appears very similar to the
     form used by Hand I in the Smock Alley <hi>Henry VIII</hi> PB (see II.iv.64-68, 69). Since,
     however, apart from 'Stet', Hand I in <hi>Errors</hi> is markedly different from Hand I in
      <hi>Henry VIII</hi> and since there is good reason for believing that 'Stet' is the work of
     the otherwise different Hand I in each play, this particular form of 'Stet' furnishes no link
     between <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Henry VIII</hi>. </note>

     <p>Since the Smock Alley PB of <hi>The Comedy of Errors</hi> contains no scene settings (like
      the 'Nursery' PB; see Vol. III of this series), actors' names, advance character calls, calls
      for stage properties or sound effects, and act notations, the following collations have been
      divided into only two categories: <hi>F stage directions altered; new stage directions
       added</hi> and <hi>Textual cuts and textual changes</hi> (the second category combining what
      are usually treated as separate categories because the principal <hi>textual changes</hi> are
      immediately related to <hi>textual cuts</hi>. </p>

       86 (perhaps 86-88) and 98-100, these lines being restored in each case by 'stet' at left of
       center rule, the two 'stet's (i.e., 'Stet' and 'stet'), however, being in different hands,
       the first by Hand I, the second by Hand II. Originally only parts of this speech seem to have
       been cut: 89-91 and 94-97 being separately boxed and crisscrossed, 101-102 being crossed
       through, with a line drawn between 100 and 101. Hand II writes 'stet' six times down the left
       margin, in each case opposite a separately marked group of lines, a move intended to reverse
       the complete cutting of the passage, which had been indicated by boxing lines and a large,
       heavy crisscross. Hand II's 'stet's, however, have been crossed through for 89-91 and 94-97,
       and all the 'stet's canceled by a vertical line drawn through them. Four stages may,
       therefore, be postulated: partial cutting, complete cutting, complete <!-- </page> -->
       <!-- <page n=82><ID>Sha8CEP82</ID> --> restoration, and a second partial cutting. NPB cuts
       89-91, 98-106; Hull gives 85-93 to Balthazar, the remainder of the speech to Angelo;
       Inchbald, Kemble (as partially in PB) assign 85-106 to Angelo but break the speech after 93

       scratched out but marked 'Stet' by Hand I; 112-113 boxed. Hull+ cut 111-113 (later rephrasing
       111) and expand Dromio of Syracuse's 5-line concluding speech to 11 prose lines, similarly
       though differently expanded by Woods. </p>
