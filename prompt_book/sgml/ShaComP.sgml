<p>THIS prompt-book of <hi>The Comedy of Errors</hi> is, I believe, the only  
surviving Restoration prompt-book of a Shakespearean play which can be connected, though  
perhaps only indirectly, with the London theatre.<note target="n1">1</note>

calls it is possible to construct the following complete cast for the  
play: <note target="n2">2</note></p>

<p>Two definite points emerge from a study of this cast: it contains  
the names of no major actors or actresses;<note target="n3">  
3</note> and those names (John Coysh, Thomas Disney, Mrs. Sarah Cooke  
and Mrs. Wall) which can be identified with known theatrical  
performers in the Restoration are, with the exception of Mrs. Wall,  
all associated with Thomas Killigrew's King's Company. <note target="n4">4</note>   
Reference to Genest and Nicoll shows that  
Coysh, spelled 'Cash', <note target="n5">5</note> played one of  
the roles in Thomas Duffett's <hi>Spanish Rogue</hi>, produced about  
March of 1672/3,<note target="n6">6</note> and Genest remarks  
that "from the names of the performers it seems probable that it came  
out at a nursery for the King's Company." Of the actors named,  
however, only two (Cash and Powell) <note target="n7">7</note>  
were not established  
  
<!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=3> -->  
  
members of the King's Company since at least 1669 and the title-page of <hi>The Spanish  
Rogue</hi> asserts that the play was performed by "His Majesties Players." Coysh also  
appeared in Nathaniel Lee's <hi>Nero</hi> at Drury Lane in May, 1674, and continued to  
play minor roles with the company down to 1681. Coysh is linked with Mrs. Sarah Cooke in  
John Leanerd's <hi>The Country Innocence</hi>, presented about March 1676/7 at Drury  
Lane, and with Thomas Disney and Mrs. Cooke in Leanerd's <hi>Rambling Justice</hi>,  
presented about March 1677/8 also at Drury Lane. He also appeared in William  
Chamberlayne's <hi>Wits Led by the Nose</hi>, produced at Drury Lane about July 1677.  
I have singled out these three last plays because, apart from the fact that Coysh is here  
associated with Disney and Mrs. Cooke, Genest, as in the case of <hi>The Spanish  
Rogue</hi>, links two of them (<hi>Rambling Justice</hi> and <hi>Wits Led</hi>)  
with the Nursery and the other (<hi>Country Innocence</hi>) with what he calls "the  
younger part of the Company." The seeming contradiction here has been dealt with by P. H.  
Gray in a useful article called "Lenten Casts and the Nursery: Evidence for the Dating of  
Certain Restoration Plays." <note target="n8">8</note> He argues that a Nursery provenience for these (and other)  
plays is a mistake arising from a confusion on Genest's part between the "younger part of the  
Company" and the Nursery (of which Genest mistakenly thought there were two at this  
period, one for each company); that, in fact, none of these plays was acted at or by the  
Nursery but at the Theatre Royal <note target="n9">9</note> by the younger or hireling members, as distinguished  
from the share-holding members, of the King's Company. Gray bases his argument on the  
assumption that the actors at the Nursery were all young, inexperienced, apprentice actors.  
This I think is a questionable assumption. Unfortunately we know almost nothing of the  
actual personnel of the Nursery, but of neither Joseph Haines nor John Coysh who joined the  
Nursery ranks around 1667 can it be said that they were exactly inexperienced  
  
<!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=4> -->  
  
apprentices. <note target="n10">10</note> It is possible, I think, that Dryden's well-known lines in <hi>Mac  
Flecknoe</hi> have somewhat biased our view of the Nursery and that, indeed, a Nursery  
company was a widely assorted one, including seasoned actors and every other  
  
<!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=5> -->  
  
gradation down to the apprentice. But the objection I have raised does not seriously vitiate  
Gray's arguments so far as the particular plays which he considers are concerned.</p>  
  
<p>Apart from Coysh, Disney, and Mrs. Cooke, the only other player in <hi>The  
Comedy of Errors</hi> cast whom I have been able to trace is Mrs. Wall. She appears as a  
member of the cast in the Smock Alley prompt-book (MS) of John Wilson's  
<hi>Belphegor</hi>, the production of which has been dated either about 1677 or  
1682-83.<note target="n11">11</note> It is also possible that Mrs. Chocke should be identified as the mother of the  
precocious 'Miss Denny Chock' who, in 1696, at the age of six, spoke a smutty epilogue at  
Drury Lane.</p>  
  
<p>The problem in the case of <hi>The Comedy of Errors</hi> is considerably  
complicated by the absence of any exact date around which to work. Authorities seem to  
agree that Coysh, Disney, and Mrs. Cooke were younger members of the King's Company  
by 1677 (Coysh by 1673), but Coysh at least (and we have no record of either Disney or  
Sarah Cooke before 1677) was, as we have already observed, at the Nursery in Hatton  
Garden with Captain Bedford around 1667. It would also seem highly probable that both  
Disney and Mrs. Cooke were at the Nursery before 1677 Thus the apparent Nursery  
connection throws some question on a King's Company (Theatre Royal) provenience.  
Moreover, in no other cast preserved for the Lenten or other vacation performances allowed  
to the "younger members" of the King's Company (and the same statement may be made for  
the Duke's Company) are there anything like the number of noncenames. As we have seen,  
of the twelve individuals named in <hi>The Comdy of Errors</hi> cast only three appear  
in the records of the King's Company or, with one exception  
  
<!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=6> -->  
  
elsewhere. For this reason alone the Nursery provenience seems more likely than one which  
supposes such a large number of otherwise totally unknown actors and actresses among even  
the hireling ranks of the King's Company.</p>  
  
<p>A combined performance between three younger members of the King's Company and  
recruits from the Nursery is, of course, another possibility, either as a Lenten or vacation  
play at the Theatre Royal, or as a Nursery production "glamourized" by the addition of  
King's Company actors. But such a supposition seems on the whole unlikely.</p>  
  
<p>A third different, though related, provenience remains to be considered. In August,  
1672, John Coysh, presumably with allowance from George Jolly, then patentee of the  
Nursery, led a troupe of players to Norwich. <note target="n12">12</note> Unfortunately no details of the personnel of  
the troupe have survived, but in all probability it was composed of members of the regular  
Nursery Company, for it seems to be generally agreed that Nursery companies (probably  
under the title of the Duke of Monmouth's Men) toured in the provinces. From 1673-1681  
Coysh seems to have been a regular, if minor, member of the King's  
Company, <note target="n13">13</note> and does  
not appear again connected with provincial touring until 1683. Since both Thomas Disney  
and Sarah Cooke were regular members of the King's Company by  
1677,<note target="n14">14</note> the 1672  
Norwich tour would give a date when all three might well still be members of the Nursery  
and willing to undergo provincial touring conditions. It may also be noted that the fourth  
identifiable name in <hi>The Comedy of Errors</hi> cast, Mrs. Wall, also fits into a  
possible 1672 Norwich performance.</p>  
  
<!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=7> -->  
  
<p>Setting aside the unlikely possibility of a King's Company provenience for the  
prompt-book, all the evidence points to a date at least before 1677 and probably earlier than  
1673. The absence of Haynes from the cast may possibly indicate a date after 1667.</p>  
  
<p>On the evidence so far advanced I have argued, fairly I believe, against a direct King's  
Company provenience for this prompt-book. But two pieces of evidence must still be  
considered which further link <hi>The Comedy of Errors</hi> and this particular  
prompt-book with Killigrew's company. First, <hi>The Comedy of Errors</hi> (as well as  
<hi>Midsummer Night's Dream</hi>) was among a group of plays assigned to Killigrew in  
1667/8. This means that the acting rights in the-play belonged to the King's Company. Since,  
however, neither the <hi>Errors</hi> nor the <hi>Dream</hi> was later produced in the  
regular repertory of the King's Company, this fact does nothing more than underline the  
already established contacts with the King's Company and may even be interpreted to support  
a Nursery provenience. The second point seems at first sight rather more difficult to account  
for in terms of a Nursery (or Nursery-related) provenience: that is, Hand II in <hi>The  
Comedy of Errors</hi> (see below) appears also, I believe, as one of the principal prompt  
hands in the King's Company prompt-book of Shirley's <hi>The Sisters</hi>. The date of  
this production can be placed with certainty between 1668 and 1671. <hi>The Sisters</hi>  
was acted by leading members of the King's Company, actors like Beeston, Cartwright,  
Haines, Mrs. Knepp, and Nell Gwyn appearing in the cast. Montague Summers in his study  
of <hi>The Sisters</hi> prompt-book assigns the prompter's marginalia to Charles Booth,  
who as Downes describes him was 'sometime Book-keeper' at the Theatre  
Royal. <note target="n15">15</note> The  
ascription may in part be right, but there seems to be no real evidence to support it.  
Moreover, there are at least two and probably three different hands at work in the prompt  
notations,  
  
<!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=8> -->  
  
a complicating fact which Summers does not appear to consider. Exact identification of the  
hand common to the two prompt-books is not perhaps of immediate significance for the  
present study, though it might conceivably be suggestive. The important point is the  
appearance of this hand in a promptbook associated on almost every other count with either  
the Nursery or a Nursery touring company. It is possible that part of the answer to the  
difficulty lies in the disastrous fire which almost ruined the King's Company in January of  
1671/2, destroying part of the theatre, their costumes and scenery. Possibly in the period  
immediately following that fire Booth, or more likely another prompter formerly associated  
with Killigrew's men, found work with the Nursery and perhaps (since the dates fit in very  
neatly) accompanied Coysh's troupe to Norwich later in  
1672.<note target="n16">16</note></p>  
  
<p>At this point the argument has been carried as far as our very fragmentary knowledge  
of the Nursery and provincial companies will allow. The case against considering this  
promptbook as one belonging to the King's Company proper seems to me strong. To  
distinguish between the claims of the Nursery and those of a provincial Nursery touring  
company (most probably at Norwich) is much more difficult and in this instance not of great  
importance since the actors and the acting version would be essentially the same in  
both.</p>  
  
<p>Two hands may be distinguished in the prompt notations. Hand I, an early type of  
secretary hand, is responsible for textual changes and cutting and occurs again in the  
'Nursery' cutting of <hi>Midsummer Night's Dream</hi>. Hand II, a fairly consistent  
Italian hand (with occasional secretary <hi>e</hi>'s) is associated with the calls for the  
characters (regularly by actor's name) and  
  
<!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=9> -->  
  
with stage business. This hand appears also in the King's Company prompt-book of Shirley's  
<hi>The Sisters</hi>, where again characters are usually called by actors' names.</p>  
  
<p>The prompt-book was prepared in a copy of the First Folio. Unfortunately, at some  
stage in its history, probably before it was divided from the rest of the volume and bound  
separately, the last page of the text (sig. I2) was lost. The missing page has been restored  
from another copy of the First Folio -- with small comfort to us!  
<note target="n17">17</note> It is quite possible that this  
final page contained a license from the Master of the Revels or his  
deputy, <note target="n18">18</note> a license  
which might have settled the whole problem of provenience immediately.</p>  
  
<p>The absence of any indications of scene-settings in this prompt-book is unusual for the  
Restoration, though significantly, perhaps, the same lack of settings is found in the Smock  
Alley prompt-book of <hi>The Comedy of Errors</hi>. Their absence in the Smock Alley  
version may be explained, perhaps, by the fact that the play never seems to have reached  
production. <note target="n19">19</note> But this explanation will not serve for the 'Nursery' prompt-book. Probably  
the answer lies in the nature of <hi>The Comedy of Errors</hi> itself, since the play  
requires almost nothing in the way of formal settings. Bell's text (1774), for example, edited  
by Francis Gentleman, gives a single setting for the whole play ('<hi>A public  
Place</hi>').<note target="n20">20</note> Where one set served for the whole play no indication of the set used would  
necessarily appear in the prompt-book. I advance a similar argument to explain the absence  
of scenes in the Smock Alley <hi>Henry VIII</hi> prompt-book,  
  
<!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=10> -->  
  
but, so far as I know, there is no actual evidence of Restoration practice in such a  
case.</p>  
  
<p>Apart from the absence of scenes, <hi>The Comedy of Errors</hi> bears the  
characteristic marks of Restoration prompt-books: 'Act Ready' placed a number of lines  
before the conclusion of each act (except the last, which, though missing, would not  
presumably call for the 'Act'); 'Ring' at the end of each act for the inter-act music; and  
points of entry marked with the usual diagonal crossed line. The prompter's habit of using  
actors' names instead of the usual character names in his calls has already been noticed. He  
also at times, most often at the beginning of an act where no advance calls had been entered,  
writes in the actor's name above or below the character name in the Folio stage direction.  
This characteristic appears in various other Restoration prompt-books, but only very  
sporadically within any single prompt-book. <note target="n21">21</note></p>  
  
<p>A total of 378 lines has been cut by the reviser (probably Hand  
1).<note target="n22">22</note> This leaves a  
play of approximately 1,375 lines. <note target="n23">23</note> The cutting here is somewhat lighter than that in the  
Smock Alley version, where the play is reduced to around 1,208 lines. In discussing the  
Smock Alley version, Professor Bald suggests that it was being prepared as an after-piece.  
This is possible, but the difference in length between these and the later eighteenth-century  
acting versions which were not played as after-pieces is so comparatively slight that it does  
not seem very likely. <note target="n24">24</note> On the whole the cutting in the 'Nursery' version is aimed at  
reducing the number of lines in the long speeches, particularly that of Aegeon in I.i. The  
parts of Adriana and Luciana have also  
  
<!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=11> -->  
  
been quite heavily cut throughout, as also that of the Abbess in the last scene. Apart from  
these the only major cut comes in II.ii.67-110 -- a passage of tiresome nonsense between  
Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse. The character of Luce has been either intentionally  
dropped or confused with that of Luciana; at any rate Luce's lines in III.i are spoken by  
Mrs. Cooke who plays the role of Luciana.</p>  
  
<p>An important aspect of this prompt-book, and one which helps to explain the amount of  
cutting, is the number of songs and dances which both Hand I and Hand II have inserted  
throughout, usually at the beginning of a new scene. Three songs are called for and three  
dances (including 'Wingfields Jigg'). No indication of added songs or dances appears in the  
Smock Alley prompt-book. <note target="n25">25</note></p>  
  
<p>The earliest recorded post-Restoration performance of <hi>The Comedy of  
Errors</hi> did not take place until 1741.<note target="n26">26</note> Two earlier adaptations, <hi>Every Body  
Mistaken</hi> (1716) and <hi>See If You Like It</hi> (1734), were never published and  
are presumably lost. The earliest acting version, as altered by Thomas Hull, was privately  
printed in 1770.<note target="n27">27</note> In 1774 Francis Gentleman, in Bell's <hi>Shakespeare</hi> (Vol VIII),  
produced a text in which he suggested a number of cuts; he makes no claim, however, to  
'regulation' from the official prompt-book, although it is possible that this version may owe  
something to the 1741 revival. <note target="n28">28</note></p>  
  
<p>The complete collation of the 'Nursery' prompt-book  
  
<!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=12> -->  
  
which follows has been compared throughout with the cuts and readings found in (1) the  
Smock Alley prompt-book, of uncertain date but almost certainly before 1700; (2) Thomas  
Hull's version (revised edition, 1793); and (3) Francis Gentleman's text, in Bell's  
<hi>Shakespeare</hi> (Vol. VIII, 1774). Occasional reference is also made to the version  
of Hull's text in Inchbald's <hi>British Theatre</hi> (Vol. I, 1808), and the cuts in the  
Collier-Perkins Second Folio (1632) have likewise been compared.

<note id="n4">4. The appearance of a 'Mr. James' in the cast  
raises, of course, the problem of a possible relationship with the  
Mrs. James who was a regular member of the King's Company from, at  
least, June of 1669. The problem is further complicated by the slight  
uncertainty of the reading 'M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>; it is barely possible that  
we should read M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>s.' (see the PB, sig.  I1<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, p.  
97). Apart from the difficulty posed by Mrs. James' early association  
with the King's Company (see later discussion below), the fact that  
the James who figures in <hi>The Comedy of Errors</hi> plays the role of  
Aegeon makes it most unlikely that Mrs.  James could be involved,  
though admittedly not impossible (scarcely, however, a breeches role!)  
. Mr. James was perhaps the husband of the King's Company actress,  
though it may be noted that Montague Summers (<hi>The Restoration  
Theatre</hi>, 1934, p. 334) claims that "About 1677 she was by force of  
Love Erept the Stage." I do not know his authority (he is using  
Downes' well known words in <hi>Roscius Anglicanus</hi> (1708), where,  
however, they are applied to three actresses of the Duke's Company),  
but it is true that Mrs.  James disappears from the casts of the  
King's Company about 1677.</note>

be Martin Powell. He was certainly a member of the King's Company by

constitutes a link with Bedford's Nursery group which Haynes had  
presumably just left) and he and Coysh were in turn petitioned against  
in 1675/6 (see Nicoll, I, 320). Martin Powell is: also identified as  
the 'Poel' who acted with Coysh in a production of <hi>The Indian

his company at Cambridge and, after visiting many towns, both actors joined Edward  
Bedford at the newly opened Nursery in Hatton Garden." I wish it were possible to be more  
certain of this date. Haynes' biography is a mass of conflicting statements. I suspect that  
Miss Rosenfeld bases the place of meeting with Coysh on the statement in Tobyas Thomas'  
<hi>The Life of the Late Famous Comedian, Jo. Hayns</hi> (1701), pp. 4-5, which  
recounts how, after Haynes had taken his M.A. at Cambridge, he met 'Costa' and at Cosh's  
invitation he "<hi>Metamorphoses</hi> his Cap and Gown to a Plum of Feathers, and a  
Persian Robe; . . . After he had strowled thus about some Parts of the Country, he comes to

<hi>Haynes</hi> betakes himself to the King's Play House in Drury-Lane, is entertain'd,  
at which time the Rehearsal writ by his Grace the Duke of Buckingham, was to be Acted; . .  
." Actually, of course, Haynes went to Oxford, not Cambridge, where he entered Queen's  
College and matriculated 3 May, 1659, although there is no record that he received any  
degree (see <hi>Alumni Oxonienses</hi>, ed. Joseph Foster, 1891, II, 681; Wood  
mistakenly [<hi>Athenae Oxonienses</hi>] gives the date as 1689). According to  
Chetwood (<hi>The British Theatre</hi>, 1750, pp. 119-120), when Haynes was at  
Queen's he came to the notice of Sir Joseph Williamson, who, when he became Secretary of  
State, made Haynes his Latin Secretary. Haynes, however, could not keep state secrets and  
Sir Joseph had to discharge him, giving him letters to the "Heads of the University of  
<hi>Cambridge</hi>, where he was willingly received; but a Company of Players coming  
to <hi>Stourbridge</hi> Fair, near that place, Joe fell so much in Love with their  
Employment and Way of Living, that he threw away his Cap and Band, and made one of  
their Company. He was soon called to the King's Company in <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> . . . "  
(Baker, <hi>Biographia Dramatica</hi>, 1812, Vol. I, Pt. I, 308, simply repeats  
Chetwood's account). The connection with Sir Joseph Williamson is suggestive, since  
Williamson was also a Queen's College man and (so the <hi>D.N.B.</hi> tells us) a great  
friend to Queen's College men. Williamson, however, did not become Secretary of State  
until 1674, long after Haynes was well launched on his erratic dramatic career. It is possible,  
however, that Haynes became associated with him in 1662 when Williamson became  
secretary to Sir Edward Nicholas. Unfortunately, the Cambridge incident, as told by  
Chetwood, sounds rather like an attempt to bring the story as told by Thomas into line with  
Haynes' Oxford education. We do know, however, that the Nursery in Hatton Garden was  
built probably during 1667 (Nicoll, I, 312) and that Haynes had joined the King's Company  
by March 1667/8 (see Pepys' <hi>Diary</hi>, ed. H. B. Wheatley, 1896, VII, 354-55).  
Since the schedule here outlined is pretty close, I would suggest that perhaps 1666 would be  
a better date for the meeting of Coysh and Haynes.</note>

earlier date, but suggests 1682-83 as an equally good possibility. In  
the absence of other evidence for the existence of a Mrs. Wall,  
Stevenson suggests that "Wall" in the <hi>Belphegor</hi> cast may be an

<note id="n15">15. See Montague Summers, "A Restoration  
Prompt-Book," <hi>Essays in Peto</hi>, n.d., pp. 103-110. Summers is  
able to limit the dates through the cast of actors.  He repeats the  
statement about Charles Booth in <hi>The Restoration Stage</hi> (1934),  
p.  142, but without any further supporting evidence.</note>  
  
<note id="n16">16. Against this, particularly if Booth is the  
person concerned, is the fact that the King's Company seems to have  
been functioning again in late February of 1672 at Lincoln's Inn  
Fields (see Leslie Hotson, <hi>The Commonwealth and Restoration  
Stage</hi>, [1928], p. 254) . The fact that the characters are called  
for their entries by the actor's name makes it impossible to consider  
the suggestion that the prompt-book was first prepared by Booth and  
then turned over to the Nursery for performance. The prompter, whoever  
he was, was intimately connected with this specific performance of the  
play.</note>

agreement in readings or cuts with the 'Nursery' prompt-book. For a  
discussion and collation of the Douai MS, see my article "The Douai

contains a cast identical to that in the 'Nursery' <hi>Comedy of  
Errors</hi>, but with the addition of a thirteenth actor (Mr. Kew).
