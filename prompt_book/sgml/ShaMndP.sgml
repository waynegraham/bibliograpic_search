<head>Introduction  
<lb>  
<hi>A Midsummer Night's Dream</hi>  
<lb>  
First Folio  
</head>  
  
<p>THE 'Nursery' version of <hi>A Midsummer Night's Dream</hi> is not a 
prompt-book, but a simple cutting of the play.<note target="mnd1">1</note>  
It contains no prompter's notations. It is possible, however, to link 
this cutting with the 'Nursery' promptbook of <hi>The Comedy of 
Errors</hi> by the appearance in it of a common hand (Hand I in 
<hi>Comedy of Errors</hi>) and by the general method of marking cuts. It 
is, moreover, fairly certain that at one time the two separately bound 
volumes were parts of the same copy of the First Folio. <note target="mnd2">2</note></p>  
  
<p>As the collations show there are almost no verbal alterations,   
but the hand in the three that do occur (see for example I.i.79), as   
I have noted, is the same as Hand I in <hi>The Comedy of   
Errors</hi>, and in both versions the cutting seems to be   
connected with this hand. It may also be observed that there is   
very little verbal alteration in <hi>The Comedy of Errors</hi>.   
Unfortunately everything from the end of act three (and a leaf   
containing parts of acts one and two) is missing, making it   
essentially impossible to say much about the cutting as a whole.   
Judging from what is left, however, the amount of deletion seems   
heavy: 511 lines in the first three acts, a figure which does not   
include what I suspect to be heavy cutting at the beginning of Act   
II  
  
<!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=28> -->  
  
and some probable cutting at the end of Act I.i. I should judge,   
therefore, a figure of 575 lines for the first three acts would be a   
fair estimate. With this we may compare the 460 lines cut in the   
first three acts of the Smock Alley prompt-book (in all, Smock   
Alley cuts around 611 lines), in itself an example of rather heavy   
cutting. The Smock Alley version thus runs to roughly 1,491 lines;   
allowing for around 575, lines in the first three acts and about   
170 for the last two (by analogy with Smock Alley), the 'Nursery'   
version will work out at about 1,357. <note target="mnd3">3</note>  
</p>  
  
<p>The most interesting cut is the attempt to get rid entirely of   
the character of Titania or at least so much of her role as is   
concerned with the quarrel with Oberon over the little Indian boy   
and the consequent Bottom-enchantment episode. It is unfortunate   
that even in this case the loss of the leaf containing the end of Act   
I and the beginning of Act II makes the full extent of the cut   
somewhat conjectural. But it is certain, that lines 60-97 must have   
been deleted since they are entirely concerned with the Titania-Oberon   
quarrel, and almost certainly lines 19-31. In fact as the   
cutting now stands Oberon's first speech comes at line 245" just   
after the exits of Demetrius and Helena. In the prompt-book,   
however, there is a cross in the left margin opposite this speech.   
Since, in order to make the speech, Oberon must have entered at   
least fifteen to twenty lines (perhaps more) earlier, this cross   
cannot indicate his point of entry. In the Smock Alley prompt-books   
a cross is frequently used to mark the place of an insertion.   
Here, although no insertion  
  
<!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=29> -->  
  
was written in, there is an obvious need for some explanation of   
the "flower" referred to by Oberon in line 247, Shakespeare's   
earlier handling of the matter having been cut entirely. It may be   
noticed that this drastic cut also removes the Bottom-Asshead   
incident and would necessitate the later cutting of Bottom's dream   
(IV.i.203-23). As a result it is not clear what exactly is supposed   
to frighten the "hempen homespuns" at III.i.108. Presumably,   
however, Puck, although both his speeches have been cut, was   
meant to appear and scare them away; his entry has been   
preserved at line 55. Such, at any rate, is the way ?Settle handles   
the situation in his operatic version of the play called <hi>The   
Fairy Queen</hi> (1692). Puck watches them perform the   
Pyramus and Thisbe parody (inserted here by ?Settle) and then   
without a word 'Robin <hi>runs in amongst them</hi>' and the   
mechanicals '<hi>Exeunt, running several ways</hi>!'.</p>  
  
<p>Since like the Padua <hi>Winter's Tale</hi>, the 'Nursery'   
<hi>Midsummer Night's Dream</hi> is merely a cutting of the   
play which apparently never reached production, only two pages   
have been reproduced in facsimile: sigs. N1<hi rend="sup">v</hi> (p 146) and   
N5<hi rend="sup">v</hi> (p 154). The collation, however, records, as usual, all   
the cuts and notations for the whole play.</p>  
  
<p>The cutting of the 'Nursery' <hi>Midsummer Night's   
Dream</hi> has been compared throughout with: (1) the Smock   
Alley prompt-book (almost certainly before 1700); (2) <hi>The   
Fairy Queen</hi> (1692), an operatic version frequently   
attributed to Elkanah Settle; (3) David Garrick's operatic version,   
<hi>The Fairies</hi> (1755)<note target="mnd4">4</note>; (4) George Colman's and David   
Garrick's acting version (1763)<note target="mnd5">5</note>; (5) Francis Gentleman's   
suggested cutting in Bell's <hi>Shakespeare</hi> (1774), vol.   
VIII.</p>  
  
<note id="mnd1">1. For a discussion of the probable 'Nursery' provenience, see   
the Introduction to the 'Nursery' <hi>Comedy of Errors</hi>.</note>  
  
<note id="mnd2">2. This relationship can be deduced from the pattern of   
staining in the upper, outer corner of the leaves in both.</note>  
  
<note id="mnd3">3. The eighteenth-century acting versions have been so   
drastically shortened that comparative figures are not very helpful.   
Garrick's <hi>The Fairies</hi> (1755) reduces the play to about   
695 lines (of which 133 are song lyrics) and omits the whole of   
the fifth act; the Colman-Garrick version (1763) runs to about   
"364 lines (of which 189 are again song lyrics) and also omits all   
but 18 lines of Act V. Francis Gentleman (Bell's   
<hi>Shakespeare</hi>, 1774, vol. VIII) marks only 176 lines for   
cutting, but the version he presents (despite William Jaggard's   
entry [<hi>Shakespeare Bibliography</hi>, 191 l, p. 410]) makes   
no claim to be 'regulated' from the prompt-book of either house. In   
a note at the end of Act I he adds; ". . . a little of the serious part   
might perhaps be spared, but so small a portion, we have not   
marked the different lines."</note>  
  
<note id="mnd4">4. There are actually two editions of Garrick's text, both   
dated 1755. See my note in <hi>Notes and Queries</hi>, N.S.   
(1959), X, 410-411.</note>  
  
<note id="mnd5">5. This version seems to owe its final published form to   
George Colman (see George Winchester Stone, "<hi>A   
Midsummer Night's Dream</hi> in the Hands of Garrick and   
Colman," <hi>PMLA</hi> (1939), LIV, 467-482). I have not   
included George Colman's <hi>A Fairy Tale</hi> (1763) in the   
versions examined.</note>

Garrick cuts 250-252, 254-256, 267-268; Colman, 251-252, 255-256,

<p>1 s.d.-34 <hi>Enter Queen</hi>...neere.] 
Circled. Part of the cutting to get rid of Titania (see Introduction, 
p. 28). F, PB, and Smock Alley PB mark no new scene here. Smock Alley 
PB cuts 2-7, 16-26; Settle retains 1-8 and parts of the 'Song', but 
greatly expands with 'A Prelude', dances, elaborate scene change, etc; 
Garrick cuts 7 ('Sing . . .') -8, 25-26.</p>  
  
<p>98-99 What wicked . . . eyne?] Crossed 
through. Smock Alley PB cuts 94-99; Settle, 94-99; Garrick, 88-89, 
94-99; Colman, 90-99; Gentleman suggests cutting 92-97.</p>  
  
<p>117-122 Things growing . . . booke.] 
Circled. Gentleman suggests cutting; Smock Alley cuts 117-120; Settle 
heavily re-writes; Garrick cuts 115-122; Colman, 117-119.</p>  
  
<p>143-144 And all . . . Knight.] Crossed 
through. So Colman; Smock Alley PB substitutes 'Ile all my powers 
addresse with love and might / To Ho&lt;nour&gt; Helle&lt;na&gt; / 
favor &lt;me&gt; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nig&lt;ht&gt;'; Settle substitutes 'O may I 
never, never see thee more; / <hi>Helen</hi> the Goddess I must now 
adore.'; Garrick cuts 136-144.</p>

<p>79 s.d-82 <hi>Enter Robin</hi>...cause.]  
Circled. Cut because of the reference to Titania (see Introduction, p. 
28). Note that Puck's entry is retained above at 55 but that he says 
nothing since his speeches here and at go are cut. Garrick cuts III.i 
entirely and reports as part of Puck's speech in III.ii.6-34 (reduced 
to 6 lines) how Titania has fallen in love with a 'clown'.</p>  
  
<p>90 <hi>Puck</hi>.  A stranger . . . here.]  
Crossed through. Settle cuts because he handles what follows quite 
differently.</p>  
  
<p>108 s.d.-III.ii.40 <hi>The  
Clownes</hi>...eyde.] Circled through 166; the remainder  
criss-crossed diagonally. The exit for the 'Clownes' should not  
presumably have been included in the cut. The cut as a whole gets rid  
of business relating to Titania (see Introduction, p. 28). Smock Alley  
PB cuts 143 and III.ii.20-23, 27-30; Settle, 157-162, 174, 182-201 and  
III.ii. 3, 7-30 (35-40 completely rewritten); Garrick, III.i entirely  
and III.ii. 1-4 (' . . . messenger:'), 8, 9-l 1 ('rude . . . to'),  
12-32, 37; Colman, 143, 175-176, 181 and III.ii.9-11('Mechanicals . .  
to'), 13-16, 18-30, 32, 39-40; Gentleman suggests cutting  
III.ii.1-34.</p>
