Smock Alley <hi>Macbeth</hi><lb> 
Third Folio</head> 
 
<p>THE Smock Alley prompt-book of Macbeth has suffered a somewhat 
adventurous career. After the play was separated from the original copy 
of the Third Folio (1664) by Halliwell Phillipps, <note target="n1">[1]</note>  
four pages (pp. 711, sig.  3O4; 714 
[misnumbered], sig. 3O6<hi rend="sup">V</hi>; 719, sig. 3P3; 722, sig. 
3P4<hi rend="sup">V</hi>) were exhibited in the "Rustic Wigwam" at 
Hollingbury Copse, Brighton, and the last page of the play (p. 729, sig. 
3Q2) was eventually bound up with the Smock Alley <hi>Hamlet</hi>, the 
first page of <hi>Hamlet</hi> (p. 730, sig.  3Q2<hi rend="sup">V</hi>) 
being the verso of the last page of Macbeth. <note target="n2">[2]</note>  
All but the last page found their way to the 
Folger Shakespeare Library, where they were reassembled.  <note target="n3">[3]</note>  
The last page has only recently come to light 
with the discovery of the Smock Alley <hi>Hamlet</hi> prompt book in the 
Halliwell Phillipps collection of the University of Edinburgh Library. 
All these leaves unfortunately bear the marks of their exhibition: wavy 
ink lines running vertically through the text on the side of the leaf 
not intended for exhibition. The damage to the last page of Macbeth is 
especially heavy (see below, pp. 6-7) and indicates that the first page 
of <hi>Hamlet</hi> was also exhibited at some stage in its history, 
probably at Hollingbury Copse. 
 
<!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=2> --> 
 
</p><p>Professor R. C. Bald's identification of 'Smyth' (Hand III), who plays 
Seyton in V.iii, with the Smock Alley actor Henry Smith who died in 1682 
sets a definite date after which what may be considered as probably the first 
acted form of the Smock Alley prompt book cannot have been prepared. 
<note target="n4">[4]</note> 
The only other actors named are John Totterdale (at V.v.8, Hand III), who 
also played in Henry VIII and Othello, and 'farlow' (at III.i.22, 101-104, 
Hand  ?III ). Nothing further is certainly known of Farlow, but Totterdale 
seems to have been acting in Dublin from about 1674 to 1688. 
<note target="n5">[5]</note> Totterdale's 
name, therefore, would seem to suggest an early limit of about 1674 for this  
form of the prompt book. Further possible narrowing of the two limits  
(1674 and 1682) will be discussed later. 
 
</p><p>It is possible, as Professor Bald points out, 
<note target="n6">[6]</note> to distinguish what 
appear to be three layers in the prompt markings and four principal 
hands. Hand I (which appears as Hand I in <hi>Hamlet</hi>, <hi>Lear</hi>,  
and <hi>Twelfth Night</hi> and as Hand II in <hi>I Henry IV</hi>) does nothing but mark the scene 
settings. Hand II, probably the earliest of the prompt hands, indicates 
the characters to be called and seems responsible for much of the 
cutting and occasional textual changes. It appears again as Hand II in 
<hi>Hamlet</hi> and <hi>Othello</hi> and is perhaps the same hand responsible for the 
<hi>Julius Caesar</hi> couplet. 
<note target="n7">[7]</note> Hand III, another prompt hand and the same as 
Hand I in <hi>Othello</hi>, marks a second stage in the preparation of the play 
and is largely associated with bringing the performance, as originally 
outlined by Hand II, into closer conformity with certain aspects of 
D'Avenant's version of Macbeth (published 1674), particularly in 
III.iii, IV.i, and V.viii. Hand IV, a peculiarly coarse and heavily 
formed hand, occasionally makes changes in Hand III's notations, cuts a 
few lines, supplies prompt notes on off-stage effects, and tidies up 
generally. It occurs also in <hi>Hamlet</hi> 
 
 
<!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=3> --> 
 
(Hand III), <hi>Merry Wives</hi> (Hand I), <hi>Othello</hi> (Hand VI), and the 
<hi>Julius Caesar</hi> acting list and is the principal prompt hand in the Smock 
Alley <hi>Belphegor</hi> manuscript prompt-book. It is also possible to distinguish 
a fifth hand (Hand V) in connection with a few textual emendations near the 
beginning of the play which appear  to be echoes of Pope's text (1723). 
<note target="n8">[8]</note> 
What seem to be other hands occur occasionally, but I have been unable to 
associate them with any of the hands in the other Smock Alley prompt-books.  
In the collation which follows all changes and additions and most 
deletions are either assigned to one of the five hands listed above 
(sometimes with a query) or marked as by an unidentified hand. The 
attempt to determine the hands responsible for the deletions (by circling, 
crossing through, and criss-crossing) is based on a study of the various inks 
usually associated with a particular hand. There is, of course, considerable 
danger in this method, and I have tried to indicate those cases where the 
evidence seemed especially ambiguous. 
 
</p><p>In the collation I have compared the Smock Alley Macbeth with the 
following stage or stage related versions:  
(1) the Padua prompt-book (see Volume 1 of this series; referred to as 
Padua PB);  
(2) Sir William D'Avenant's adaptation, 1674 (edited by Christopher 
Spencer in <hi>Five Restoration Adaptations of Shakespeare</hi>, Urbana, 1965; 
referred to as D'Avenant) and the Yale manuscript of D'Avenant's 
adaptation (edited by Christopher Spencer, <hi>D'Avenant's "Macbeth" from the 
Yale Manuscript</hi>, New Haven, 1961; referred to as Yale MS, but not 
included in the collation unless differing significantly from the 1674 printed 
text).  
(3) The Douai manuscript, 1694 (in the Douai Public Library, MS 7.87, 
fols. 171-209; referred to as Douai MS).<note target="n9">[9]</note>  
(4) The Garrick version, 1744 (in Bell's <hi>Shakespeare</hi>, 1773, Vol. I; referred 
to as Bell).<note target="n10">[10]</note>  
(5) The John Lee version, Edinburgh, 1753 (referred to as Lee);  
(6) The Lee Edward Salmon prompt-book 
 
<!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=4> --> 
 
(in a copy of the 1753 edition, now in the Harvard Theatre Collection, 
marked by Edward Salmon, the prompter, and belonging to West Digges, 
who played the role of Macbeth in Edinburgh on 26 December 1757; 
referred to as Lee Salmon PB, but only where it differs from Lee). 
<note target="n11">[11]</note> I have 
also included the cuts indicated in the Collier Perkins Second Folio, 1632 
(referred to as Collier MS). 
 
</p><p>Two distinct versions of Macbeth emerge from the work of Hands II and 
III. Hand II seems to have blocked the play out, making a few verbal 
changes (I.iii.120, 145-146; I.vi.9; III.i. 16-17, 28), marking certain 
passages or scenes (III.vi, V.ii) for cutting, a total of roughly 163 
lines, and writing in the prompt calls for the characters. He regularly 
omits the characters of Angus and Lennox, except for one occasion each 
(V.i.63-64 and IV.ii. 125), when they were inadvertently, I think, 
included. In the General Introduction to this series (I,i,19) I 
suggested, following R. C. Bald, <note target="n12">[12]</note>  
that Hand II's version may 
represent the original form in which Smock Alley played Macbeth. This 
view I no longer consider seriously tenable. It is much more likely that 
Hand II's version represents a preliminary draft for prompt use and that 
this "prepared book" was then taken over by Hand III and further adapted 
for the stage with additional emphasis on D'Avenant's version. An 
analogous situation may be found in the Smock Alley <hi>Hamlet</hi>, where, I 
have suggested, possibly the same hand (Hand II) performed essentially 
the same kind of preliminary spadework. <note target="n13">[13]</note> 
 
</p><p>Hand III initiates less cutting than Hand II (roughly 127 lines as 
compared with some 163),<note target="n14">[14]</note>  
although in a number of cases he reinforces 
Hand II's suggested cuts by further marks of deletion.  On the other 
side, his individual textual revisions are much more numerous, 
particularly in III.iii, IV.i, and V.viii, scenes in which D'Avenant's 
influence is particularly marked. Hand II's 
 
<!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=5> --> 
 
few verbal changes suggest some vague knowledge of D'Avenant, and his 
cuts sometimes parallel those in D'Avenant's version. Hand III's changes, 
however, quite apart from the three scenes noted above, reflect a closer 
recollection of D'Avenant's wording, although almost invariably with 
slight verbal inaccuracies or changes. This strongly suggests that Hand III 
worked from memory, without having a text of D'Avenant's version to 
consult.<note target="n15">[15]</note>  
Such a view might be considered one reason why the Third Folio 
text was employed as a prompt-book. But all the Smock Alley productions 
of Shakespeare used the Third Folio text as a source for the prompt-book. It 
is, moreover, conceivable that the company preferred Shakespeare's basic 
text, using D'Avenant only in those scenes (the murder of Banquo and the 
handling of the Apparitions) where his revision did not interfere materially 
with the original. A somewhat similar case occurs in the Smock Alley <hi>King 
Lear</hi>, in which Shakespeare's text is used until V.ii, at which point some 
form of Tate's happy ending appears to have been tacked on. 
 
</p><p>The suggested absence of a printed text of D'Avenant's version, first 
published in 1674 but performed as early as 1664, may also be advanced as 
an argument for placing the Smock Alley production of Macbeth at the 
earliest possible date--Totterdale's advent in the company in 1674. If, indeed, 
a printed copy of D'Avenant's text was literally not available, this would 
explain the apparent reliance of Hands II and III on recollections of the 
London performances. While an early limit (1674) must be allowed as a 
possibility, I still incline to the opinion I expressed in the General 
Introduction to this series (I,i,19): between 1674 and 1682, with some 
preference for a later rather than an earlier date. 
 
</p><p>Hand IV seems certainly to be the latest of the main prompt hands. 
Although it is principally concerned with prompt notations, particularly off-stage  
effects or special business, e.g., I.iii.3-4; II.iv.10-13, 21; III.ii.22-23;  
III.iii (opening); III.v (opening and end); V.vii (opening), it makes a 
few cuts (about 38 lines, limited to IV.iii, V.iii, V.iv, and V.viii), one 
change of scene (IV.i), and occasional verbal substitutions ( IV.iii.8, 
 
<!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=6> --> 
 
 
123, 191-192; V.v.11). Hand IV also restores Folio 'Rosse' for Hand 
III's'Macduffe' in I.ii.45 s.d. and I.iii.88 s.d. (from D'Avenant) and Folio 
'Saward' for Hand III's 'Rosse' in V.vii.4 s.d. (D'Avenant, 'Lennox'). There 
is, I believe, some evidence to suggest that Hand IV worked on the prompt-book  
at two different times. The changes made in Hand III's notations and 
some other notations are written in a faded black-brown ink, while those 
calls which seem merely to tidy up Hand III's work are generally in a light 
brown ink. It seems possible, therefore, that some of Hand IV's changes 
may reflect a somewhat later version of the play. But the evidence is 
tenuous, sometimes uncertain, and resists any definite conclusion. 
 
</p><p>It is difficult to give a very satisfactory account of the total number of lines 
cut in the Smock Alley <hi>Macbeth</hi>. But as the play finally emerged under 
Hand IV about 328 lines seem to have been deleted from the original and 
about five lines, which do not merely substitute for deletions (see III.iii.11-22;  
V.vii.11; V.viii.32-34), added. Also probably another twenty lines (the 
second (?) song from D'Avenant's version called for in II.iv.10-13, 21) 
must be included as an addition. All this leaves a production of about 1,781 
lines, somewhat shorter than the Padua PB, D'Avenant, Douai MS, Garrick, 
Lee, and Lee-Salmon versions.<note target="n16">[l6]</note>  
The principal cuts are as follows: II.iii.5-23, 28 ('of three . . .')-46  
(the Porter scene); III.vi (the scene of comment 
between Lennox and a Lord); IV.ii.30-64,  
79-85 (the last part of the scene of Lady Macduff's murder); IV.ii.117-123  
('Devilish . . . detraction.'), 125-137 ('I am . . . Quarrel.'), 139 s.d.-159 (' . 
. . Grace. ') (parts of the Malcolm Macduff interview); and V.ii (scene of 
comment by Macbeth's enemies). 
 
</p><p>The final scene (V.viii) requires special comment. This scene occurs on the 
last page of <hi>Macbeth</hi> (p. 729, sig. 3Q2 ) and has been defaced by the 
nineteenth-century exhibitor. In addition to double verticle lines down each 
column, two of Hand II's advance calls, Hand III's added lines at the 
bottom of the page, the running title, and the catchword have been crossed 
through, each with a single pen stroke. All these deletions must, I think, 
 
<!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=7> --> 
 
be "credited" to the vandal exhibitor. They are made more neatly, if 
that is a virtue, than the usual run of deletions in this prompt-book. 
If this explanation is accepted, the general intention in the final 
scene is clear enough, although the cutting in lines 35-53 is somewhat 
confusing. Even so, however, the scene as here developed does nothing to 
clear up the difficulty in the Folio text as to where Macbeth dies, on- 
or off-stage. Here, as in the Folio, he seems to die on-stage, with a 
line lifted from D'Avenant's version of the scene in which he does 
indeed die on-stage. At this point, Macduff, with a line original to the 
Smock Alley prompt-book 'Soe may all tyrants fall.' exits, re-entering 
immediately after the entrance of Malcolm, Siward, Ross, etc. (lines 35-53  
being cut) with Macbeth's head. Unless he cuts it off before exiting, 
where does Macduff get the head? At best this suggests an awkward bit of 
stage business, all the more surprising in the Smock Alley 
production in view of D'Avenant's handling of the matter, by more 
decorously substituting Macbeth's sword, which Macduff takes from the 
dying Macbeth just before his exit and produces triumphantly on his re-entry  
some lines later. Was the taste of an Irish audience more Elizabethan  
than Augustan? 
 
</p><p>In a number of instances the changes made in the Smock Alley prompt-book  
parallel those found both in the earlier Padua prompt-book and in 
eighteenth-century productions; all such parallels are recorded in the 
running notes to the collation. It should be noticed, however, that the 
attitude here dictating the cutting in the Porter scene differs from that at 
work in the Padua prompt-book. In Smock Alley "decorum" and D'Avenant 
are pretty clearly responsible, although I do not believe that there is 
otherwise much evidence of a desire to "refine" Macbeth except in the 
matter of language. As usual in Restoration versions (contrast the Padua 
prompt-book), Shakespeare's diction and syntax have been simplified, 
sometimes, but not always, with the aid of D'Avenant 
(e.g., I.iii.55-57, 120, 145-146; II.iii.131-133; II.iv.40;  
III.i.16-17, 110; III.iv.60, 75, 103, 105, 106; IV.i.69, 90, 
92-94; IV.ii.75; IV.iii.8, 133, 191-192; V.iv.11; V.Viii.14, 32-34),  
or "poetic" passages simply deleted (e.g., I.iii.125-126, 137-142; 
I.vi.3-9; I.vii.2-12; II.iii.135-138;  
III.i.122-126; IV.iii.117-123, 125-137, 171-173). The desire 
to clarify what seemed involved, difficult, or obsolete accounts for a large 
number of the changes and cuts, and sometimes the poetic quality of the 
play  
 
<!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=8> --> 
 
suffers though considerably less so than in D'Avenant's "flattened" 
adaptation. 
 
</p><p>Two further points may be mentioned. Hand III's importation of Banquo 
into II.iv in the place of the Old Man is so far as I know unique to the 
Smock Alley production. His presence there may perhaps be explained by 
the implied inclusion of the Witches in Hand IV's call for a song and dance 
at lines 4-5 and 10-13, since Banquo would be a more suitable spectator for 
this extra effect than an anonymous Old Man. In V.iii.36, 48, and V.v.51-52,  
Hand IV deletes the references to Macbeth's armor (missing, however, 
the first one at V.iii.33-34), and Hand III cuts the reference to his shield at 
V.viii.32-34. Such deletions point to a costuming of Macbeth more in 
keeping with Restoration military dress than with Shakespeare's conception, 
a view borne out by several eighteenth-century theatrical paintings and 
engravings.<note target="n17">[17]</note> 
 
</p><p>The scenes employed in the Smock Alley Macbeth are for the most part 
stock: Court (I.ii,iv,vi; III.i,iv; V.i), Towne (II.iv,deleted; 
IV.iii; V.ii), Groue (III.iii; V.iv), Castle (V.v), and Chamber (II.i; 
III.iv, deleted).  These scenes all appear in other Smock Alley 
plays,<note target="n18">[18]</note>  
but three scenes are found only in Macbeth: Rock (I.i,iii; 
II.iv; III.v; IV.i, deleted), Garden (I.v; IV.ii), and Caue (IV.i). The 
'Rock' scene is regularly associated with the Witches and must have been 
specially prepared for this play. It is possible that the 'Caue' scene 
substituted by Hand IV in IV.i represents a refinement introduced at 
perhaps some later date. The only setting which raises any particular 
question is the use of 'Towne' for the interview between Malcolm and 
Macduff (IV.iii), a scene which according to Shakespeare's text is 
supposed to take place at the court of Edward the Confessor in England. 
Possibly some slight influence of the unity of place may be detected 
here and in D'Avenant, who, curiously enough, sets the scene in Birnam 
Wood.</p>

Totterdale had a son baptized at St. John's in Dublin in November, 1675. 
He also notes (p. 289) that Mrs. Elizabeth Farlowe or Farlee was a 
member of the King's company.  She disappears from the London stage 
after April, 1678 (see <hi>The London Stage</hi>, Part I, ed.  William 
Van Lennep [Carbondale, 1965], p. 15 <hi>et passim</hi>) . It is 
possible, though not, I think, very likely, that Mrs. Farlowe played the 
role of the Servant. If so, this would place the date of the Smock Alley 
production between 1678 and 1682.</note>

Theobald's 1733 text and shows no connection with the theatre. An 
edition of <hi>Macbeth</hi> published in 1785 (with casts for that year at Drury 
Lane and Covent Garden) reproduces essentially the Garrick version as it 
appears in Bell (1773).</note>

<note id="n14">14. The figures given for the cutting by Hands II, III, and IV are 
necessarily tentative, since, frequently, the only clue to which hand is 
at work is the color of the ink used in the marks of deletion--a 
dangerous criterion. I have included a cut as belonging to a particular 
hand even when I have felt it necessary to query the attribution.</note> 
 
<note id="n15">15. It may be noted that a somewhat similar situation exists in the 
Smock Alley <hi>Hamlet</hi>. There is, however, some slight evidence 
that, despite the inaccuracies of Hand II's changes when compared with 
the so called actors' quarto (1676), an actual copy of the printed text 
of that quarto was used to some degree.</note> 
 
<note id="n16">16. I have used Alfred Hart's figure of 2,084 lines for Macbeth ("The 
Number of Lines in Shakespeare's Plays," <hi>RES</hi>, VIII [1932], 21). 
D'Avenant's version runs to roughly 2,124 lines; Padua PB to 1,808; 
Douai MS to 1,888; Garrick (Bell) to 1,846; Lee to 1,857; Lee-Salmon to 
1,826. The figure of 352 lines cut in the Smock Alley Macbeth as given 
in my General Introduction (I,i,27) was a careless error.</note> 
 
 
<note id="n17">17. Compare the illustration by du Guernier to Macbeth (IV.i) in Rowe's 
1709 edition (actually it represents a scene from D'Avenant's version), 
the famous painting by Zoffany of Garrick in the role of Macbeth (II.i), 
and Dawes' painting (IV.i). See W. M. Merchant, <hi>Shakespeare and the

substituting Macduff for Ross, Hand III was following D'Avenant, who 
completely omits the characters of Ross and Angus from his version of 
the play. PB cuts the character of Angus throughout, though Hand II 
inadvertently included his name in the prompt call (later cancelled) for 
V.ii. Lee retains Angus, but Lee-Salmon PB deletes him here and 
elsewhere; both retain Ross. Gentleman (Bell) remarks that at Covent 
Garden the "characters of <hi>Rosse</hi> and <hi>Angus</hi> have been

<p><xref doc="mac231">1-46]</xref> The order of cutting and restoration in 
these lines is uncertain. In what seems to be the final form, 5 ('Here's 
. . . ' )-23 and 28 ('of three . . . ')-46 were cut. Judging by the inks 
used, Hand II first deletes, by circling, the whole of 1-46, then 
changes his mind and marks both circled sections with 'stet' and 
'stett'. Hand III then crisscrosses 5-23 and 28-46 for deletion, adding 
'to sle&lt;ep&gt;' at the end of 27 to complete the sense. Hand IV tidies 
things up by placing an advance call for Macduff and Ross at II.ii.52 
(deleting Hand II's call at the beginning of scene iii) and an advance 
call for Macbeth at II.ii.74. Apparently Hand II neglected to mark an 
advance call for Macbeth; however, see above, II.iii (opening). The 
order of events as here described presents certain problems, but I am 
unable to offer any more satisfactory alternative. Padua PB cuts the 
whole of the Porter's soliloquy; D'Avenant also cuts the soliloquy, 
reduces the Porter's role to one line (he, 
here called Servant, and Lennox enter together and after three lines Macduff 
enters), and replaces 23-46 with eleven lines  
 
<!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=17> --> 
 
between Lennox and Macduff based on F lines 59-66; Douai MS reduces 
the Porter's soliloquy to 'P: here's a knocking indeed: who's there in the 
name of belzebub? anon; anon; I am coming.  (Opens the doore.)' and 
omits 27-46 ('and drink . . . him.'); Bell cuts everything down to Macduff's 
entry (24), the Servant, who has opened the '<hi>door</hi>' to Macduff and Lennox, 
being given F 26-27 ('Faith . . . cock:'), and then adds Lennox's speech from F (59-66). 
These last two speeches are in italics, and Gentleman (Bell) remarks: ". . . 
and the Italic lines, by transposition, judiciously introduced to give <hi>Macbeth</hi> 
time for change of appearance, of which, even now, he is allowed too 
little."; Lee cuts the Porter's soliloquy, bringing Lennox on alone (Lee-Salmon  
PB notes 'PS' ), '<hi>who knocks at the chamber door several times 
pretty hard, then a servant opens it</hi>.'  (Lee-Salmon PB adds 'OP'), follows 
D'Avenant's opening two speeches, inserts F 47 ('Is . . . stirring?'), and adds: 
'<hi>Serv</hi>. Not yet, Sir, but he'll scarce lye late; he's of an active spirit, that never 
suffers his body to lye still when once his mind is up. / <hi>Len</hi>. Well, say I wait 
his leisure. / <hi>Serv</hi>. I will, Sir.' Collier MS shows points of resemblance to 
Smock Alley PB, since it cuts lines 5-22 ('Here's . . . Bonfire.'), 27-46 ( 'And 
Drink . . . him.').</p>

by adding 'Banqo' and deleting 'Old man'. R. C. Bald (<hi>PMLA</hi>, LVI 
[1941], 375 n., 377-78) explains the change of setting from 'Towne' to 
'Rock' as the result of what seems to be an appearance of the Witches 
later in the scene at Macduff's entrance (20) and suggests that "at 
least one" of D'Avenant's witch songs was here used (see below, 10-13, 
21). Of the two witch 
 
<!-- </page> --><!-- <page n=19> --> 
 
songs (D'Avenant, II.v) probably the second is the more likely choice, since 
it alone is followed by a dance in D'Avenant's version (the first sixteen lines 
of the song also appeared in the 1673 quarto of <hi>Macbeth</hi>, interpolated 
between scenes iii and iv, which is otherwise substantially a reprint of 
F1). The substitution of Banquo for the Old Man in PB may also perhaps be 
explained by the importation of the Witches, since their song might seem 
more suitable for Banquo's ears, though it should be noted that the 
directions implying the Witches are in Hand IV. In D'Avenant the scene is 
carried by Lennox and Seyton, down to Macduff's entrance; nor do the 
witch songs appear in this scene. They are part of the following scene (II.v), 
a scene ('<hi>An Heath</hi>.') almost entirely D'Avenant's own creation, and are 
directed at Macduff and Lady Macduff. Bell, Lee retain Shakespeare's scene 
with Ross and the Old Man, but place it at the beginning of Act III, inserting  
a scene with all the Witch business, but minus the Macduffs, from 
D'Avenant II.v. Bell, Lee-Salmon PB exit the Old Man just before 
Macduff's entry. Clearly PB, Bell, Lee have one aim in mind: entertainment 
at any cost. Lee gives no scene setting; in Bell '<hi>The SCENE changes to a

Alley company "<hi>c</hi>. 1674," but this date depends, I assume, on dating the

Farlow here plays the Servant, and the position of the advance call at 22 
suggests that he was intended to enter about 44 (as in the Padua PB); 
editors, from Rowe on (followed by Bell, Lee), assume the Servant to be

largely to bring it into line with D'Avenant's version.  Originally the 
scene was planned as written; Hand II's calls for 'Murtherers' at 
III.ii.44 and 'Banquo / ffleans' at the beginning of scene iii indicate 
this (though the number of the 'Murtherers' is ambiguous). As Hand III 
sets the scene up, Banquo and Fleance cross the stage first and are 
immediately followed by the 'two' Murderers, whose dialogue has been 
considerably cut to resemble D'Avenant's. The Murderers follow Banquo 
and Fleance off-stage and the scene ends. R. C. Bald (<hi>PMLA</hi>, LVI [1941], 
377) is surely mistaken when he says "it is interesting to note that, 
while Davenant makes the actual murder occur off-stage, in the Dublin 
version Banquo and Fleance do not even come on beforehand." In D'Avenant 
the three Murderers enter first, speak nine lines, and exit; then Banquo 
and Fleance enter, speak five lines, and exit; the Murderers re-enter, 
speak four lines, and go out after Banquo and Fleance; finally, Fleance, 
pursued by the Murderers, re-enters on the run and throws a single line at 
the audience. Bell follows F1 (though with some cutting) down to 18 (' 
. . . Slave!') and cuts the remainder of the Murderers' lines; Banquo 
dies on stage. Lee follows a heavily cut version of F1 down to the 
entrance of Banquo and Fleance and turns to D'Avenant for their 
speeches; after their exit, the Murderers (First and Second) are given 
an original line each and then pursue Banquo and Fleance off-stage; 
finally, Fleance re-enters to deliver D'Avenant's single line.</p>

'mile: ' (the blot over the 'e' may have been intended to delete the F colon), 
crosses through 12-13 ('but . . . do,'), and substitutes 'the horse way is'; at this 
point he apparently planned to keep the rest of the speech as it was, only 
inserting 'usually' after F 'Gate', but he changes his mind, deletes 'usually' 
and F 'it' (14), interlining 'this' above, deletes F 'walk.', and inserts 'usuall 
walke' following. He then adds the speech for the Second Murderer, above 
and below the F s.d. '<hi>Enter Banquo . . . Torch</hi>.', which curiously enough 
remains undeleted. As a result of the crowding of Hand III's first changes, 
his intention is not clear, and it is possible that he meant the first line to read 
'1. the horse way is / almost a mile: about'. Lines 14-22 are circled and x'd 
through, though perhaps Hand III's 'come Lets away' was suggested by F 
'Well, let's away' (22). Compare D'Avenant: '<hi>1. Mur</hi>. His Horses go about 
almost a Mile, / And men from hence to th' <hi>Pallace</hi> make it their usual 
walk.'; and later, when the Murderers re-enter: '<hi>1. Mur. Banquo</hi>, thou little 
think'st what bloody feast / Is now preparing for thee. / <hi>2. Mur</hi>. Nor to what 
shades the darkness of this night, / Shall lead thy wandering spirit.'.</p>

has no call for Hecate or '<hi>the other three Witches</hi>', but it 
does not cancel the F s.d. at 38, nor does it reassign Hecate's speech 
at 39. D'Avenant, who went in for all the witches he could get, retains 
the three extra witches, as do Douai MS and Bell. Lee goes even further, 
reading the s.d. at 38 as '<hi>Enter</hi> Hecate <hi>and all the singing 
Witches</hi>.' and assigning the parts of the song in D'Avenant's 
version specifically to the 'singing Witches'. D'Avenant (also in the 
Yale MS) assigns the last part only of 61 to a fourth witch, but the 
context makes it clear that he really means Hecate; Douai MS, Bell, Lee 
do not follow him.</p>

note dropped in the second edition, Gentleman remarks: "In a very bad 
alteration of this play, by <hi>Betterton</hi> [i.e., D'Avenant], he has hit upon what

trifling superfluous dialogue, between Lady <hi>Macduff</hi>, <hi>Rosse</hi>, and her son, 
merely that another murder may be committed, on the stage too. We 
heartily concur in, and approve of, striking out the greatest part of 
it." In the second edition (1774), he drops this note but adds: "The 
character of Lady <hi>Macduff</hi>, and consequently this scene, is entirely 
omitted, at some theatres, as unnecessary to representation, the fatal 
catastrophe of the family being finely introduced in another part of

see 123, above; Lee, after turning 123-125 ('Here . . . Nature,') into 
'And here abjure my former accusation:', cuts 125-131 ('I . . . self,'),

approach,' and inserts 'here' after 'approach,'. Cut in the rewriting by 
D'Avenant, Lee; Douai MS changes to 'thy coming hither'. It will be noted 
that Hand III's change here suggests that he originally included these lines, 
and probably those of the preceding cut, and supports the view that the 
cutting at this point is the work of Hand IV (see above, 113).</p>

cutting by Hand II. Padua PB retains the Doctor but cuts 149 ('How . . . ')-159;  
D'Avenant cuts the Doctor but retains eight lines on the King's healing 
power (completely rewritten); Bell, Lee, Collier MS cut as in PB. 
Gentleman's comment (Bell) is pungent and to the point: "The author has 
here lugged in, by neck and heels, a doctor, for the strange purpose of 
paying a gross compliment to that royal line, which ridiculously arrogated a 
power of curing the evil, by a touch. But that scene is properly left out in the 
representation." This note, as usual, is considerably softened in the second 
edition (1774).</p>

out F '<hi>Doctor</hi>,'. Hand II seems to have planned the scene as in F (see above, 
V.ii.25). When, however, scene ii was cut, by Hand ?III, it became necessary 
to change the Doctor's entrance to avoid an exit at the end of V.i and 
immediate re-entry at the beginning at V.iii. The initial move to get rid of 
scene ii has been attributed to Hand III because the Doctor's entrance at 33-34  
is partly in Hand III ('Enter [<hi>Hand IV</hi>] Doc&lt;tor&gt; [<hi>Hand III</hi>]') 
and would seem to suggest that Hand III, therefore, had something to do 
with the cutting of scene ii. Such an explanation supposes that Hand III 
allowed Hand II's call for Macbeth and the Doctor at V.ii.15 to serve, 
neglecting to cancel the call for the Doctor at that point. Why the call for the 
Doctor, tentatively assigned to Hand ?IV, at the beginning of scene iii 
was deleted (if it was not accidentally smudged) is not clear. D'Avenant 
omits the Doctor; Bell, Lee enter him at 37, essentially as in PB (the first 
edition of Bell, 1773, accidentally retained him in the opening s.d.).</p>

<p><xref doc="mac5336">36 Give me mine Armour:]</xref> Crossed through (Hand IV). The line carried on

of the Doctor's actual entrance. This is the first of three cuts relating to 
Macbeth's armor (see below, 48 and v.51-52), and it would seem that the 
intention was to dress Macbeth in some costume more nearly contemporary; 
if so, then 33-34, above, were overlooked. Note that the reference to 
Macbeth's shield at V.viii.32-34 is part of a cut by Hand III. That this was 
the intention, however, is suggested by the deletion of all references to 
armor in D'Avenant, followed by Lee (except for the reference to 'Hamess' 
in V.v.51-52); Bell retains the references to armor, indicating, perhaps, a retum to 
more historical costuming (see, however, p. 8, note 17).</p>

above</hi>] Chance to dye / Fight. / Macb: farwell vaine world and that 
which is most vaine / Ambition. / Macd:  Soe may all tyrants fall.

Fight</hi>, Macbeth <hi>falls.  They shout within. / / Macd</hi>. This for . . . I'le 
as a Trophy bear / Away his Sword, to witness my Revenge. [<hi>Exit</hi> Macduff. 
/ <hi>Macb</hi>. Farewell vain World, and what's most vain in it, Ambition. / 
[<hi>Dies</hi>.'. The added lines in PB have been crossed through, but again 
presumably by the nineteenth-century exhibitor. The action in PB is not 
entirely clear. The F s.d. at 34 '<hi>Exeunt fighting.  Alarums. / Enter 
fighting, and Macbeth slain</hi>.' has been left untouched, but the added 
lines in PB seem to rule out any exit and make it clear that Macbeth is 
slain on stage immediately after fighting with Macduff, who then exits, 
as in D'Avenant. It is surprising that PB retains the business of 
Macbeth's head, in view of D'Avenant's more decorous substitution of his 
sword, followed by both Bell and Lee.  Since Macbeth's body apparently 
remains on stage (a difficulty also with the F text), one must suppose 
that Macduff exits with the head at 34.  Bell, Lee give Macbeth an eight-line  
dying speech (described by Gentleman as "furnished by Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi>, 
to give the actor more eclat"; though he admits that "from the desperate 
state of Macbeth's mind, we think his immediate death most natural."); 
the speech begins with two lines suggested by D'Avenant's line ''Tis 
done! the scene

<p><xref doc="mac5835">35-53 <hi>Mal</hi>. I would . . . comfort.]</xref> 
The lines have been deleted in probably three stages. First, 38-53 (' . 
. . him.') were partly circled and crisscrossed by Hand III; second 36-37  
seem to have been circled and the last half of 53 crossed through by 
Hand IV; third, 35 was included in the cut with 36-37 by Hand IV 
(perhaps the third stage was actually a part of the second). The 
original arrangement (Hand III's) gave Malcolm and Siward three-and-a-half  
lines before Macduff's entry at 53; the final arrangement (Hand 
IV's) brings Macduff on directly after Malcolm, Siward, Ross, etc. 
D'Avenant reduces the F lines to seven; Bell, Lee retain F essentially 
unchanged.</p>
