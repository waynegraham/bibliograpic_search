               <h2> I: The Smock Alley Twelfth Night </h2>
               <p>THE Smock Alley <em>Twelfth Night</em> prompt-book (PB) like the Smock Alley <em>Merry Wives
                     of Windsor</em> and <em>King Lear</em>, contains no actors' names, but it is tied to other
                  Smock Alley prompt-books (1) by inclusion in S. W. Singer's list of twelve plays in "a
                  tattered copy of the third folio of Shakespeare," which showed abundant evidence of a
                  theatrical provenience (i.e., the Smock Alley Third Folio [1663/64] before it was broken up by
                  Halliwell-Phillipps);<a href="#n1" class="super">[1]</a> (2) by the appearance of a prompt-hand
                  (Hand I) that occurs in the Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em> (Hands I and II; c. 1676-79),<a href="#n2" class="super">[2]</a>
                  <em>Macbeth</em> (Hands I and II; c. 
                   1674-82), <em>Henry VIII</em> (Hand I c. 1674/75-79),
                  <em>Othello</em> (Hand II; c. 1677-78 or 1682-83), <em>I Henry IV </em>(Hand II; c. 1675-85)
                  and<em>King Lear</em> (Hand I; ? after 1681). The presence of Hand I in these other plays,
                  ranging in date from about 1674 to 1685, suggests that the Smock Alley <em>Twelfth Night</em>
                  probably falls somewhere within the same general span. If we add to this the possibility that
                  Francis Baker, who played Falstaff in <em>I</em> and <em>2 Henry IV</em>, also played Sir Toby
                  Belch (Thomas Betterton played both roles in London), then at least a terminal date of 1685,
                  the year in which Baker left Smock Alley to act with the United Company in London, may be set
                  for the Smock Alley <em>Twelfth Night</em>. 
               </p>
               <p>Hand I, the only prompt-hand in the Smock Alley prompt-book, is responsible for scene
                  settings, stage properties (one call only), sound effects, advance character calls, stage
                  directions altered or added (one of each), textual cuts (five only), and textual changes (one
                  only). Hand I, however, makes no attempt to modernize syntax or language. A second hand (Hand
                  II), an eighteenth-century hand that also appears in the Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em> (Hand
                  IV), <em>King Lear</em> (Hand III), <em>Merry Wives of Windsor</em> (Hand II), and
                  <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em> (Hand II), as usual emends the Third Folio text by inserting
                  emendations proposed by editors from Rowe (1709) through Hanmer (1743). Only selective
                  readings by Hand II are recorded in the Collations (see <em>Textual changes</em>). 
               </p>
               <p> Like the Smock Alley <em>Merry Wives</em>, the Smock Alley <em>Twelfth Night</em> is very
                  lightly cut (only 10 lines out of a total of 2,429).<a href="#n3" class="super">[3]</a> Of its five
                  cuts, two (I.ii.62; III.i.52-54) may have been made to remove "bawdry"; one (II.iv.87) because
                  of an error in the Third Folio text that makes nonsense of the line; and two (II.iv.5-6;
                  III.iv.290-292) because the passages concerned are not immediately clear in meaning. A few
                  lines may possibly (though not, I think, probably) have been cut on Folio pages 265 and 266,
                  where a substantial part (lower outer corner of sig. Z1) has been torn away, affecting the
                  text as follows: III.i.59-99 ('bring a . . . own'), enough inner marginal text remaining to
                  rule out 
                   any cuts; III.i.124-163 ('Myself . . . pride,');
                  III.ii.6-50 ('<em>And</em>. Marry I . . . although the'); III.ii.76-III.iii.18 ('ever believe
                  . . . firm,'), enough outer marginal text remaining to rule out any cuts. 
               </p>
               <p> The Smock Alley <em>Twelfth Night</em> has been compared throughout with the following
                  theatre texts (the first possibly earlier than the Smock Alley PB): Folger Second Folio
                  <em>Twelfth Night</em> cuts about 36 lines; (2) Douai MS <em>Twelfth Night</em> (1694), cuts
                  about 266 lines; (3) <em>Twelfth Night</em> in John Bell's <em>Shakespeare's Plays, As they
                     are now performed at the Theatres Royal in London</em>, Vol. V (1773), cuts about 235 lines;
                  (4) John Philip Kemble's Covent Garden <em>Twelfth Night</em> (n.d., about 1811), cuts about
                  the same number of lines as in (3), but individual cuts differ.<a href="#n4" class="super">[4]</a>
                  The so-called Collier MS has also been consulted. 
               </p>
               <p> The scene settings are stock (occurring in other Smock Alley prompt-books) and are limited
                  to three: 'Presence' (used once), 'Towne' (used three times), and 'Court' (used or implied
                  thirteen times). The last two are the most frequently used among Smock Alley settings;
                  'Presence' appears elsewhere only in <em>Othello</em>.<a href="#n5" class="super">[5]</a> Obviously,
                  it was not intended to mount <em>Twelfth Night</em> with any unnecessary expense. 
               </p>
               <p> Because both the Smock Alley <em>Twelfth Night</em> and <em>Merry Wives</em>
                  <a href="#n6" class="super">[6]</a> are, comparatively, so lightly cut, it is tempting to think that
                  they may represent first steps in the preparation of the final prompt-books and that some hand
                  other than the main prompt hand (Hand I in both) was expected to go over the play again with
                  an eye to more substantial cutting. Against such a view, however, except for the lack of
                  significant cutting, both are quite adequate to serve as actual prompt-books. Moreover, the
                  comparatively small amount of cutting (c. 36 lines) in the Folger Second Folio <em>Twelfth
                     Night</em> PB, of uncertain date and possibly earlier than the Smock Alley <em>Twelfth
                     Night</em>, suggests that <em>Twelfth Night</em> at least, if not Merry Wives, was not
                  considered as a play demanding much shortening. Finally, the length of both plays after
                  cutting (Smock Alley <em>Twelfth Night</em>, c. 2,419 lines; Folger Second Folio <em>Twelfth
                     Night</em>, c. 2,393 lines; <em>Merry </em>
                  
                  
                  <em>Wives</em>, c. 2,582 lines) is considerably less than the Smock Alley acting texts of
                  <em>Hamlet</em> (c. 2,860 lines) and <em>Othello</em> (c. 2,808 lines).

                     substantial amount of prose in <em>Twelfth Night</em>, line-counts are more than usually open
                     to variation depending on the format of the particular text being referred to.

               <h2> II: The Folger Second Folio Twelfth Night </h2>
               <p>The Folger Second Folio <em>Twelfth Night</em> (hereafter Folger F2 PB) has no connection,
                  so far as I know, with Smock Alley and is of unknown provenience. Like the Smock Alley
                  prompt-books, however, it also belonged at one time to Halliwell-Phillipps, who describes it
                  in his <em>Some Account of the Antiquities, . . . In the Possession of James Orchard
                     Halliwell, Esq.</em> F.R.S. (1852).<a href="#n7" class="super">[7]</a> Of its history before 1852,
                  however, nothing is known, although it seems probable that it has a London (or English
                  provincial) rather than a Dublin origin. Whatever its provenience, Folger F2 PB was never
                  completed: all prompt notations cease after IV.ii, thus ruling out its use as a workable
                  prompt-book. 
               </p>
               <p> The absence of any scene settings in Folger F2 PB suggests a question. Does this indicate,
                  perhaps, that this prompt-book should be dated some time before 1660, after which changeable
                  scenery became common in the public theatres? One characteristic of this prompt-book, however,
                  suggests that it is more probably post-Restoration: the marking of the point of entry for a
                  character by a horizontally slanted and crossed line, an entry signal often appearing in
                  Restoration prompt-books,<a href="#n8" class="super">[8]</a> but not, to my knowledge, found in
                  earlier prompt-books. 
               </p>
               <p> A single prompt-hand worked on the Folger F2 PB, which, 
                   though it is the only prompt-hand, I have called Hand
                  I. It has some superficial points of likeness with Hand I in the Smock Alley <em>Twelfth
                     Night</em> PB, but it is, I am sure, a different hand, and one that does not appear elsewhere
                  in other Smock Alley prompt-books. Hand I is responsible for the act notations, calls for
                  sound effects, advance character calls, Folio stage directions altered or added, textual cuts,
                  and textual changes. It also, with some consistency, marks points of entry with a horizontally
                  slanted and crossed line (see note 8), usually placed in the right or left margin. 
               </p>
               <p> The Folger F2 PB has been very lightly cut (c. 36 lines, leaving a play of c. 2,393 lines),
                  though slightly more heavily cut than the Smock Alley <em>Twelfth Night</em>. Of its four
                  cuts, two (II.iii.39-47, 115-121) shorten or cut song lyrics, and two get rid of dated
                  references to 'the old Hermit of <em>Prage</em>' and 'King <em>Gorbodacke</em>' (IV.ii.13-23)
                  and to 'the old vice' with his 'Dagger of Lath' (IV.ii.133-141). There is no agreement between
                  these cuts and those in the Smock Alley PB, further evidence, aside from Hand I,
                  disassociating the Folger F2 PB from a possible Smock Alley provenience. 
               </p>
               <p> The Folger F2 PB has been compared throughout with the same theatre texts listed above for
                  the Smock Alley <em>Twelfth Night</em>.

               <div class="note" id="n7">
                  <p> 7. P. 115, Item 91: "The Play of Twelfth Night, from the edition of 1632, a
                     play-house copy of about the date 1640, with the names of the characters in the place where
                     they were to be in readiness to take their parts etc. fol[io]. This volume is extremely
                     interesting, as showing the plan of an early performance of the play. It is curious to observe
                     how little is omitted from the original text. The places for 'Musicke' are noted. Instead of
                     the song at the end of Act iv, Sc. 2, we have only the following lines, I am gone, Sir, and,
                     anon, Sir / Ile be with you againe, sir." Halliwell-Phillipps fails to note that this PB was
                     never completed, and the date, "about 1640," is presumably only his best guess.

                  <p>In the Smock Alley PB Hand I makes only one certainly identifiable textual change: IV.ii.32

                     obscuring the F text, but only in this instance does Hand I make any attempt to bridge the
                     gap in the underlying F text. Hand II, an intrusive eighteenth-century hand (see
                     Introduction, p. 60), substitutes emendations proposed by Rowe through Hanmer. Only readings
                     uncertainly Hand II's and readings original (or partly original) with Hand II are here
                     recorded. After III.ii.71 Hand II's meddling ceases.
