            <h1>Introduction<br> Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em><br> Third Folio
            </h1>
            <p>THE apparent connection, somewhat confused though that connection may seem to be,
               of the Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em> (preserved in the University of Edinburgh
               Library) with one of the two 1676 actors' quartos, <a href="#n1" class="super">1</a>
               would appear to afford a date before which the prompt-book cannot have been
               prepared. There is, of course, the slight possibility that this connection may
               be explained through something like a common source, for example, the
               prompt-book in use at the Duke of York's Theatre. But as we shall see the weight
               of the evidence is against such a possibility, though influence from the London
               productions may, I believe, be postulated apart from the direct contribution of
               the actors' quartos. Other evidence for dating may be found in the names
               Trefusis and Williams (see IV.v.96; IV.vii.35; V.ii.172). Joseph Trefusis acted
               at the Smock Alley Theatre from about 1675 to 1688; David Williams left Smock
               Alley in 1679. <a href="#n2" class="super">2</a> Prompt hands found elsewhere in the
               Smock Alley promptbooks (in <em>Lear, Macbeth, Othello, Henry VIII, Merry Wives,
                  Twelfth Night,</em> and the <em>Julius Caesar</em> cast) can be identified
               in this prompt-book and serve to link it closely with these plays, several of
               which can be dated between 1674 and 1682. We may,
                therefore, with some assurance place
               <em>Hamlet</em> within a period most probably not earlier than 1676 and not
               later than 1679. Such a date makes the Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em> by more than
               seventy years the earliest prompt-book of <em>Hamlet</em> now extant. <a href="#n3" class="super">3</a> I have, with some trepidation, distinguished nine
               separate hands among the various revisions and prompt-notations. Hand I (the
               same as Hand I in <em>Macbeth, Lear,</em> and <em>Twelfth Night)</em> writes in
               the stage setting called for at the beginning of a new scene; and the same hand
               is also probably responsible for the anticipatory 'scean' calls which precede
               each scene change (see, for example, I.i. opening s.d. and 164). Hand II (the
               same as Hand II in <em>Macbeth, Othello,</em> and <em>I</em>
               <em>Henry IV</em> and Hand I in <em>Henry VIII)</em> is responsible for most of
               the entry calls for characters and for most of the textual changes and
               deletions; it is thus the most important hand in the promptbook (see, for
               example, I.i.1, 72-80). Hand III (the same as Hand IV in <em>Macbeth,</em> Hand
               VI in <em>Othello,</em> Hand I in <em>Merry Wives,</em> the hand in the
               <em>Julius Caesar</em> acting list, and the main prompt hand in Wilson's
               <em>Belphegor)</em> furnishes a few speech-prefixes and prompt-notes for
               sound effects (see I.ii.17-41; I.iii.90-92; V.i.307). Hand IV is a
               mid-eighteenth-century hand which seems to make its corrections from
               eighteenth-century edited texts; it appears again as Hand II in <em>Twelfth
                  Night</em>,<em> Merry Wives</em>, and <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em> and
               Hand III in <em>Lear </em>(see, for example, II.i.87; II.ii.197). Hand V
               (perhaps ,the same as Hand II in <em>Lear</em> and <em>Henry VIII)</em> limits
               itself to a  few textual changes (see
               III.i.173-175; IV.iii.3, 4; IV.vii.14). Hand VI (the same as that of the copyist
               in <em>Merry Wives</em> and Wilson's <em>Belphegor)</em>
               <a href="#n4" class="super">4</a> adds one actor's name, a property note, and sound
               effects (see I.iv.6; III.i. opening; IV.vii.35 s.d.; V.ii.291). Hand VII writes
               'Redy' under Hand II's calls, adds a few additional calls (see I.i.19-20;
               II.ii.116; IV.iii.89; V.i.27; V.ii.172-179) and is probably responsible for the
               crossed diagonal lines marking point of entry. Hand VIII occurs rarely and is
               concerned with changes in scene settings and with properties (see IV.ii.
               opening; IV.v. opening; V.ii. opening, 236 s.d.). Hand IX makes a few textual
               changes (see I.iii.2-4, 20; IV.v.103-106; IV.vii.6; V.i.281). What may probably
               be considered as a tenth hand appears in certain passages marked with a red
               pencil (see I.iii.22-28; II.i.80; III.iv.118-122; V.ii.338-339).
            </p>
            <p>As I noted at the beginning of the last paragraph, it is with considerable
               trepidation that I have attempted to sort out these nine hands. The evidence is
               frequently so fragmentary that often one is left grasping at a single word or
               even a few letters. Moreover the conditions under which the notations were made
               were many times unfavorable, so that the writer was cramped and his writing
               distorted. Two hands trouble me particularly. Is Hand II really responsible not
               only for the majority of the character calls and act divisions, but also for the
               greater part of the actual cutting and textual revision? I am not absolutely
               sure, and it is possible that we have here two distinct hands at work under what
               I have called Hand II. Again, is Hand V, in fact, only Hand II in a more formal
               (and secretary) guise? Since I cannot be sure of the answers to either of these
               questions, I have decided to allow the designations to stand and to let my
               comments here serve as a warning.
            </p>
            <p>The question of cutting in the Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em> presents several
               problems. Because of the difference in length between the quarto and folio
               texts, the text used by the Smock Alley performers was already, before any
               cutting was undertaken, about 115 lines shorter than the quarto version employed
               by the Duke of York's players in London. <a href="#n5" class="super">5</a> This fact
                has been kept in mind in arriving at some of
               the following figures. In the 1676 quartos (here called Q6, since the two
               quartos of that year are essentially identical for our purposes) and in all the
               later quartos (the last 1703) approximately 845 lines have been marked for
               deletion. Of the six other theatre versions here compared, Ward A and B (c.
               1745) and the 1703 Folger prompt-book employ quarto editions as the bases of
               their acting texts; <a href="#n6" class="super">6</a> the Tonson 1734 edition
               (representing the play as staged at Drury Lane about 1723) and the Garrick 1763
               edition <a href="#n7" class="super">7</a> are composite texts based on both quarto and
               folio and influenced by Rowe and later editors. The Garrick prompt-book (1772),
               to be distinguished from the 1763 Garrick version, is based on a 1747 text very
               close to that in the 1734 edition. Ward A cuts roughly 1,237 lines, Ward B about
               1,056 lines; the 1734 edition marks approximately 1,081 lines for deletion and
               the 1763 Garrick version omits about 1,220 lines. The Garrick prompt-book and
               the1703 Folger promptbook (obviously related versions) <a href="#n8" class="super">8</a> cut too drastically at the end to make comparative figures very
               helpful. <a href="#n9" class="super">9</a></p>
            <p>In comparing these figures with the amount of cutting in the Smock Alley
               <em>Hamlet</em> one is confronted not only by the discrepancy in length
               between the quarto and folio texts, but also by the difficulty of determining
               the exact amount of cutting intended. Two distinct layers of cutting may be
               distinguished. The earlier layer is, in general, indicated by a rough circling
               of a line or group of lines; the second layer by a crossing through of
               individual lines (or occasionally by rough crisscrossing of a group of lines).
               <a href="#n10" class="super">10</a> Someone apparently went
                through the play (possibly with a copy of Q6
               beside him) and circled lines and groups of lines with a view to preliminary
               cutting. This individual circled, in all, about 607 lines. Following this, Hand
               II (possibly, of course, the same person as the first 'circler') went through
               the play again, straightening out some of the tangles created by the circling,
               crossing through roughly 427 of the circled lines, at the same time crossing
               through an additional 175, making a total of 602 lines clearly marked for
               deletion. To these must be added 8 lines at IV.iv (the momentary entrance of
               Fortinbras in the folio text) which, though only circled, were certainly meant
               to be deleted, and another 7 lines in a torn section at II.ii.244 and
               III.iii.26. In all, then, the Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em> would appear to cut
               around 617 lines. Allowing for the difference in length between quarto and folio
               texts, this figure gives a version only slightly longer than that of Q6. <a href="#n11" class="super">11</a> There still remain, however, about 169 lines which
               have been circled but not otherwise marked, a number of which 'cuts' agree with
               suggested cuts in Q6. In many cases, moreover, I find it difficult to believe
               that these cuts were not finally intended, particularly, for example, in the
               play-within-the-play, which otherwise remains completely uncut. <a href="#n12" class="super">12</a> If, then, we may suppose that the cutting includes
               all the circled passages not otherwise marked for deletion by partial crossing
               through, we arrive at a final total of around 786 lines, leaving a play of
               approximately 2,860 lines, <a href="#n13" class="super">13</a> version nearly the same
               length as that of the suggested cutting of Q6 (2,832 lines).
            </p>
            <p>The relation of the Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em> to Qq. 6-7 (1676) must now be
               examined. Some connection with the text of <em>Hamlet</em> as it is found in Qq.
               6-7 (and in the succeeding quartos) is certain, but whether the connection comes
               through the use of a copy, or copies, of Qq. 6-7 or through the reviser's
               (largely Hand II) knowledge of the London production on which Qq. 6-7 are based,
               requires consideration. The evidence is confusing. Many of the cuts, both those
               circled and those crossed through, agree exactly with cuts marked in Qq. 6-7.
                Moreover, passages omitted from the quarto
               version are often circled or crossed through, and many readings (mostly
               introduced by Hand II) which appear in print for the first time in Qq. 6-7 have
               been inserted throughout in the folio text. <a href="#n14" class="super">14</a> On the
               other hand, many passages marked for deletion in Qq. 6-7 are not cut in the
               Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em>; it makes independent cuts, and it sometimes follows
               the Qq. 6-7 reading only in part, giving the appearance of a reviser working
               rather from memory than from a printed text. <a href="#n15" class="super">15</a>
               Occasionally, moreover, Hand II will alter phrasing in the folio (also revised
               or different in Qq. 6-7), but produce something quite unlike the Qq. 6-7
               reading. <a href="#n16" class="super">16</a> There is, however, one piece of evidence
               which points with some certainty to the use, at some stage, of a copy of Q6 (or
               Q7). At I.i.78 the Folio has been altered to read (Hand ?II): 'makes the night
               joynt-laborour<em>or</em> with the day:' to bring it into
               agreement with the reading of Qq. 6-7: 'Makes the night joynt labour with the
               day?' The word 'labour' in Qq. 6-7 is obviously an error (shared with Q5 [1637]
               and corrected in Q8 [1683]) and the only way in which I can explain the
               redundant form 'laborour<em>or</em>' in the Smock Alley PB is to
               postulate careless copying from a corrected copy of Q6 (or Q7). The evidence, as
               a whole then, suggests considerable but not very systematic use of Qq. 6-7, eked
               out, as I shall suggest below, with what the reviser (or revisers) remembered
               from London performances.
            </p>
            <p>At certain places the handling of the text in the Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em>
               might seem to be more closely connected with eighteenth-century usage than with
               that in Q6. The most obvious example is the omission of the dumb show in III.ii
               and the changes in the dialogue between Hamlet and Ophelia immediately
               following. Actually, however, Q6 here most probably fails to record contemporary
               London stage usage, while the Smock Alley PB preserves it, since it is most
               unlikely that the direction of influence would have been from Dublin to the
               later English stage. Other examples, where the Smock Alley PB may certainly or
               probably be interpreted as revealing contemporary
                London production or cutting, may be
               studied, in the text or collations, at I.i.30-31, 33-34, 70 (discussed below);
               I.ii.202-204; I.iii.2-4; I.iv.65; I.v.135, 142, 156; I.ii.489; III.ii.192-195;
               IV.i.1-2, 14-23, 25-27; IV.iii.8, 58-70; IV.v.147-148, 152; IV.vii.162; V.i.240
               s.d.; V.ii.278.
            </p>
            <p>In his article on the Ward prompt-books, Dr. McManaway discusses the method there
               followed for getting the Ghost on and off stage in I.i, I.iv-v, and III.iv. It
               is clear that a trap was used for the Ghost's exit in I.v and for his entrance
               in III.iv. In I.i he seems to have 'stalked' on and off both times. <a href="#n17" class="super">17</a> But Dr. McManaway and the late W. J. Lawrence would
               like to postulate the use of a trap for entrance and exit in I.i and for
               entrance in I.iv on the Elizabethan stage. The Smock Alley <em>Hamlet,</em>
               however, does not support this view; no trap seems to have been used in any of
               the scenes in question. <a href="#n18" class="super">18</a> One piece of 'business' in
               I.i should perhaps be particularly noticed since it may have some bearing on the
               presentation of the Ghost's two entrances. The quarto and folio texts contain
               lines which make it clear that Horatio, Marcellus, and Barnardo are meant to be
               seated just before each appearance of the Ghost, but the Smock Alley PB, Ward A
               and B, Folger 1703 quarto, the Garrick 1763 text, and the 1734 Tonson text
               (though the last does not for some reason appear to cut the reference in line
               30) all agree in deleting the several references to sitting. Such a change, of
               course, makes it unnecessary to have something 'on stage' upon which the three
               men can sit and hence cuts down on stage props, but it is also possible that the
               change was made to facilitate the entrance of the Ghost 'OP' or 'PS' instead of
               by way of the 'long trap' in the centre of the stage. If this argument may be
               allowed any weight, it would imply that a change took place in the Restoration
               London staging of this scene, a change not 
               reflected in Q6, and that the failure of the Smock Alley PB to employ a trap
               entrance for the Ghost need not be interpreted as evidence against Elizabethan
               use of the trap in this scene.
            </p>
            <p>The Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em> makes use of a number of the stock scenes, all
               but one appearing in several of the other plays: Castle (I.i, iv; IV.vi), Court
               (I.ii; II.ii; IV.i, iii, vii; ?V.ii), <a href="#n19" class="super">19</a> Chamber
               (I.iii; III.iv; IV.ii, v), bed chamber (II.i), Towne (V.i, ii [cancelled]),
               Church (V.i.240). The change of scene to 'Church' in V.i at line 240 introduces
               a setting not used elsewhere in the Smock Alley prompt-books; moreover a change
               of scene at this point, where the original text does not call for it, is
               interesting in itself, especially when it is also found in the 1734 Tonson and
               1763 Garrick texts, suggesting once again that the Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em>
               reflects Restoration London usage. The scene opens, we may suppose, with the
               'graveyard' set up against a flat depicting houses and perhaps the outside of a
               church (this 'Towne' setting is employed in five other Smock Alley plays); at
               line 240 the scene is drawn, <a href="#n20" class="super">20</a> discovering some sort
               of 'church interior' out of which the procession with Ophelia's body issues. At
               the conclusion of the scene, the scene would be 'closed,' as Hand I indicated
               with his setting 'Towne' at the beginning or V.ii. This scene was later
               recognized as unsatisfactory and resulted in the cancelling of 'Towne' and the
               call for a 'new sceen' by Hand VI.
            </p>
            <p>In its handling of the soliloquies the Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em> is close to Q6
               and to most eighteenth-century versions. <a href="#n21" class="super">21</a> 'To be, or
               not to be' and "Tis now the very witching time' escape untouched (though Q6 and
               the later versions cut the last three lines of the second); 'Now might I do it
               pat' also appears to be uncut, though the Smock Alley PB is imperfect here (Q6
               cuts 'Then trip . . . goes:' [93-95], but nothing in the earlier
                part of the speech which is missing from
               Smock Alley PB); 'How all occasions do inform' is, of course, omitted in the
               Folio text and hence in the Smock Alley PB, but in most of the later versions
               this speech was also cut entirely. <a href="#n22" class="super">22</a></p>
            <p>In his attitude toward Shakespeare's language, the reviser (largely Hand II)
               honors, for the most part, the modernizations found in the Q6 text. Occasionally
               he introduces variants of Q6's forms, <a href="#n23" class="super">23</a> and from time
               to time makes changes or additions of his own (see, I.ii.64; I.ii. 126, 133-134,

            <p>The Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em> has been compared throughout with the following
               seven stage versions: (1) the Betterton cutting first published in 1676 (here
               represented by a copy of the four-line imprint edition and referred to as Q6);
               the remaining quartos (1676, 1683, 1695, 1703) all present essentially the same
               text. (2) The 1734 Tonson edition, representing the Wilks' text of 1723
               (referred to as 1734). (3) Ward A and (4) Ward B (see Note 3, above). (5) The
               first Garrick version, represented by the 1763 edition referred to as 1763. (6)
               The autograph Garrick prompt-book of his 1772 version (referred to as Garrick
               PB). (7) The 1703 quarto Folger prompt-book, dating sometime after 1772
               (referred to as 1703 Folger). <a href="#n24" class="super">24</a> The cuts in the

                  John Ward probably around 1745 (hereafter referred to as Ward A [Tudor and
                  Stuart Club, Johns Hopkins University] and Ward B [Folger Shakespeare Library]).
                  Ward A makes use of one of the 1676 quartos (four-line imprint); Ward B, of a
                  copy of the 1683 quarto. See James G. McManaway, "The Two Earliest Prompt Books
                  of <em>Hamlet," PBSA,</em> XLIII (1949), 288-320. Dr. McManaway dates these two
                  Ward prompt-books 'shortly after 1740' (p. 310), but Ward's use of Warburton's
                  emendation 'Hernshaw' at II.ii.398 (Ward A) ) would suggest a date after 1744.
                  When Dr. McManaway wrote his article, the whereabouts of the Smock Alley
                  <em>Hamlet</em> was unknown and it is to his kindness that I owe my

                  1772 version (see, below, note 22). Another theatre version in the Folger
                  Library, employing a 1750 Dublin edition of <em>Hamlet,</em> dates from Richard
                  Daly's management of the Crow Street Theatre, Dublin (i.e. 1788-97). It has
                  interesting notes on the acting of Hamlet's role, but is not properly speaking a
                  prompt-book. I have not included it among the theatre versions compared in the

                  except that Rosincrantz takes the Captain's place instead of Guildenstern) in
                  the 1703 Folger PB, which concludes IV.iv and begins IV.v as follows (beginning
                  with line 59) : <br><br> "And let all sleep, Awake my Soul awake! <br><br>
                  Wake Nature, Manhood Vengeance [wake <em>deleted;]</em> rouse at once <br><br>
                  My Father's Spirit calls! the hour is come! <br><br> From this time forth--My

                  <em>Enter Ophelia distracted </em>Where is the beauteous &amp;c" <br><br> The
                  connection with Garrick's concluding lines in Hamlet's soliloquy is obvious: 'O
                  from this Time forth,/ My Thoughts be bloody all! the hour is come-- / I'll fly
                  my Keepers--sweep to my revenge.' (see Stone, <em>op.cit</em>., p. 912). On the
                  other hand, the beginning of Garrick's equivalent of IV.v shows no connection
                  with the opening lines as given in the 1703 Folger PB. Later in IV.v, however,
                  we find 1703 Folger PB following Garrick's insertion of lines 203-219 ('go but .
                  . . with me.') after line 152 ('.. . your eye.'). These points of contact with
                  Garrick's 1772 version explain why the prompt-markings stop with the end of
                  IV.v, what little remains in Garrick's version having been separately copied out
                  by the prompter (and since lost). The fact that the lines quoted from the
                  conclusion of Hamlet's soliloquy (IV.iv) agree exactly with the conclusion of
                  that soliloquy as quoted by the younger Boswell (Boswell's edition of Malone's
                  <em>Shakespeare,</em> 1821, II, 692) from another copy of the 1703 quarto
                  prepared by William Hopkins, Garrick's prompter (see Stone, <em>op.cit.,</em> p.
                  891) would suggest perhaps that this version, rather than that quoted directly
                  from Garrick's autograph copy by Stone (<em>op.cit</em>., p. 912), was the final
                  stage form and that the opening lines inserted in the 1703 Folger PB for IV.v
                  also represent Garrick's final version. If this is so, then the 1703 Folger
                  version deserves further study since a number of the earlier cuts agree only in
                  part with the cuts listed by Stone for Garrick's adaptation.

                     Originally only 72-77 were included. Hand II finally gave the passage
                     its final form, crossing through 73-77, placing 'and' at the end of 72,
                     and deleting F 'Doth' in 78; at the same time altering 78 to read 'makes
                     the night joynt-laborour<em>or</em> with the day:' (the Qq
                     all omit 'Doth' and read 'makes'). Hand ?II has also written what looks
                     like 'for' before F 'Doth' (78), an addition deleted at the same time as
                     'Doth'. It is not clear whether 'At . . . so:' (80) is meant to be cut
                     in the final version of the lines (it has not been crossed through). See
                     the Introduction (p. 6) for a discussion of 'joynt-laborour<em>or</em>'. 1763 reads the speech as in the final form in
                     PB (cutting 'At . . . so:' 80); Q6, 1734 cut 73-79(' . . . me?'), 80
                     ('At . . . so.'); Ward A, B cut 73-77 (reading 'Making' 78), 80 ('At . .
                     . so.'); 1703 Folger cuts only 80 ('At . . . so.') .

                     crossed through. The original rough circling of these lines (17
                     excepted) left the speech dangling. Hand II crossed through the last
                     half of 17 ('you . . . <em>Fortinbras,'),</em> and substituted, in the
                     right margin, preceded with a small cross, 'we have ['have' <em>smeared
                        or deleted]</em> disp&lt;atch'd&gt; / Embassadours &lt;?to&gt; /
                     young Fortin&lt;bras&gt; / And now La&lt;ertes&gt; [<em>the last three
                        words deleted</em>]'. He then crossed through 18-35, deleted F 'to
                     you' (36), interlining 'them' above, inserted 'of Treaty' (something
                     cancelled after 'of') following F 'power' (36), and deleted F 'To
                     businesse' and  'more' in 37. He
                     finally crossed through 39-41 (including the s.d.). Hand V is
                     responsible for the speech-heads 'Pol:' before 36 and 'King', affixed
                     with a caret above the beginning of 42. It is possible that the changes
                     in 36 are also Hand V's work. Some reference to the 'Ambassadours' is
                     preserved by Hand II to prepare for the report of their return in II.ii.
                     40-41, but why three of the King's lines (36-38) are given to Polonius
                     is not very clear. Originally Hand II intended to cut everything down to
                     42 (see the cancelled 'And now La&lt;ertes&gt;' above). Note also that
                     the 'Ambassadours' have been sent to 'young Fortin&lt;bras&gt;' instead
                     of to 'old <em>Norway'.</em> Q6 cuts 17-41 ('Now . . . farewell.'); 1734
                     seems to cut 17-50; Ward A cuts 16-41 ('for . . . farewell.'), linking
                     with 'And' and including 'what's . . . you?' in 42; Ward B, 63 cut 16-41
                     ('for . . . farewell.'); 1703 Folger cuts 17 ('Now . . . farewell.') and
                     links with 'And' to 42.

                     re-entry of Hamlet and the Ghost. None of the acting texts (down to
                     Inchbald) indicates any change of scene, though Ward A and B do give a
                     special call for the re-entry. Inchbald (1808) makes a new scene here
                     and describes it as: <em>'A remote Part of the Platform.'</em>
                     (following Theobald). 1703 Folger notes that Hamlet and the Ghost exit
                     'PS' (i.e., Horatio and Marcellus follow Hamlet out 'PS') and then enter
                     'OP'.

                     75-78, Hand II notes 'Act 2<em>d</em>. / begins &lt;here&gt;'
                     and 'Bed' (Hand questionable) is added above Hand I's 'Cham&lt;ber&gt;'
                     (repeated here by Hand I after cancellation at the beginning of the F
                     scene). Hand VII adds another 'Act &lt;2&gt;' opposite 73 in the margin.
                     The arrangement here arrived at by Hand II leaves Polonius with a rather
                     pointless 'Farewell:' to a Reynaldo who does not appear. Although the
                     arrangement is possible, it seems most likely that Hand II intended to

                     ('. . . Farewell.'). Collier MS cuts 24-37 ('As . . . that.') . Both
                     Garrick PB and 1703 Folger begin Act III with this scene. Ward A, B,
                     1763 adapt the Q or F std. and read <em>'Enter</em> Ophelia. meeting
                     Polonius', and Ward A, B, like PB, note 'Act Begins / Here' <em>[Ward

                     portion of 15 '&amp; to gather if ought'; then with a cross above
                     'ought' continues in the left margin with '&lt;unk&gt;nowne /

                     version. Before this, however, perhaps another Hand (though it looks
                     very much like Hand II again) had written 'if ought' after F 'gather' in
                     15 (crossed through along with the end of 15); then between 'him' and
                     '&lt;t&gt;hat' in the left margin presumably the same hand (Hand II)
                     wrote (later deleted) what looks like '&lt; &gt; w<em>th</em>

                     of which the reading is uncertain, not being deleted). To add further
                     confusion Hand IV has interlined above the deleted 18 'to us unknown
                     afflicts him thus'. 17 is missing from Ff and Hand II has obviously
                     tried to introduce a form of the Q line 'Whether ought to us unknown
                     afflicts him thus, / That lies within our remedy.' 1734 cuts 15-16
                     ('gather. . . may'); Ward A cuts 16 and reads 'learn' for 'gather
                     (15).

                     MS cuts 263-272 ('. . . Shadowes:'). It seems likely, therefore, that PB
                     also ended its cut with 276 (' . . . attended;'). The final intention in
                     PB is somewhat confused: a single vertical line has been drawn down the
                     center of the column from 231 to the point at which the tear begins
                     (this would seem to imply a cancellation of everything from 231 through
                     ?276); also at one time it was intended to include 'but your newes is
                     not true.' (243-244) as part of the original circled cut.

                     of Polonius' speech (488-489). The confusion was the result of the
                     cutting of 486 in the Betterton version (Q6), the 'So proceed.' at the
                     conclusion of Polonius' speech being intended for Hamlet. The PB reading
                     is a conflation of the two Q readings. 1734, Ward B, 1763 follow the
                     arrangement in PB, but read Hamlet's line as 'So proceed you.'; Ward A,
                     having restored 486, reverts to the Qq 2-5 reading (deleting the second
                     'So proceed.', which before 486 was restored had been assigned to
                     'Ham:'); Garrick PB retains both Q readings, assigning the second to
                     Hamlet; 1703 Folger follows PB, but reads 'So proceed.'.

                     through F 'and the Cue' (587) and places 'and that' after F 'passion'.
                     Q6, however, reads 'the motive, and that for passion / That I have?' and
                     I suspect that Hand II intended to follow Q6; however, Hand II's reading
                     makes possible sense and is not much more awkward than Q6's. 1734, 1763,
                     Garrick PB substitute 'that Ground' for F 'and the Cue'; Ward A, B
                     substitute 'that cause'; 1703 Folger restores F reading.

                     believe, part of the same call, indicating that Hamlet entered at 17
                     under the guard of 'Officers' (as 14 suggests) . There is nothing in the
                     Ff s.d.'s to indicate this; the Qq have 'They enter.' at 16, which,
                     since Guildenstern is already entered as part of <em>'all the rest'</em>
                     at 10, implies attendants of some kind. Ward A, B call the 'Officers'
                     'Attendants'; 1734, 1763, <em>'Guards'.</em> Edited texts all leave the
                     'business' here to 'Attendants' (when they list anyone as entering with
                     Hamlet and Guildenstern); the police effect of the 'Officers' preserves
                     a detail of the seventeenth-century stage effect otherwise lost, an
                     interpretation of the situation which apparently carried over into the
                     eighteenth century.

                     were cut, however, is shown by the lack of any call for either
                     Fortinbras or his army. Q6, 1734, Ward A, B, 1763 cut the whole scene;
                     Garrick PB and 1703 Folger cut out Fortinbras along with 1-8, but they

                     possibly be 'Enter' and the second an actor's name (though I can connect
                     what remains with no actor at Smock Alley at this time); if so, then the
                     star probably marks actual point of entry for Laertes (despite the
                     crossed line marking his entry at 111) . If we accept this
                     interpretation, it raises difficulties with my later identification of
                     Williams as Laertes (see V.ii.153). Another explanation may be that the
                     two words should be read as 'her noise' and that the star indicates the
                     point for the noise (this would link the star with the one above at

                     also crossed through) . It would appear then that 'Good
                     <em>Laertes:'</em> was not included in the cut, but it should be
                     noticed that Q6, which reads the lines as in PB, omits 'Good

                     like 'Call Op', later deleted, (Hand ?II). Either Hand ?II began to add
                     'Call Ophelia.' to the end of the King's line or the notation was meant
                     to indicate calls of 'Ophelia' as part of F 'A <em>noise within.'.</em>
                     In this connection, it is significant that 1734 adds, after the King's
                     speech <em>'Within.</em> O poor <em>Ophelia.'</em>, so, perhaps, what
                     Hand ?II started to write was 'Call O p'. Ward A adds 'poor Ophelia!' to
                     the end of the King's speech; 1763 gives 'O poor Ophelia!' to Horatio
                     <em>'Within</em>.'; and Garrick PB transfers the words to Laertes,
                     adding 'My' before 'poor'. Something like 'Op' has been faintly written
                     in below the F s.d. '<em>within</em>.'.

                     actor David Williams) see, Introduction, p. 1. So far as '&lt; &gt;ne'
                     is concerned (the last letter being doubtful),
                      although it may well be an actor's
                     name, I can only hazard two guesses. There was a Mrs. Kaine who appeared
                     in the Smock Alley <em>Henry VIII </em>as an Old Lady and it is possible
                     that the fop Osric was played by a woman (though not in the London
                     Betterton production) . As I noted at 61-62 above, an illegible word
                     appears to follow Osric's name in the call and it is tempting to read
                     the first letter of that word as 'K' and to read, here, '&lt;Kai&gt;ne'.
                     There may, of course, have been a 'Mr. Kaine' as well as a 'Mrs. Kaine',
                     but I know of no evidence for such an actor. Clark <em>(Early lrish
                        Stage, p.</em> 208) lists a 'Mr. Kaine', but, as I have explained in
                     the General Introduction (p. 14, n.29), this listing arises from a
                     misinterpretation. Alternatively, the call may stand for '&lt;wi&gt;ne'
                     (cf. Ward A: 'King / Queen / Laertes / Attendants / a /Flourish / [line]
                     / one with a / cup of wine').
