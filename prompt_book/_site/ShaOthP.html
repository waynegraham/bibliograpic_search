            <h1>Introduction<br> Smock Alley <em>Othello</em><br> Third Folio
            </h1>
            <p>THE Smock Alley <em>Othello</em><a href="#n1" class="super">[1]</a> shares several
               prompt-hands with other Smock Alley prompt-books and is further linked with the
               Smock Alley <em>Hamlet, Macbeth, I</em> and <em>II Henry IV, Henry VIII</em>,
               and John Wilson's <em>Belphegor</em> by the appearance of six actors' names
               (more than in any other Smock Alley Shakespearean prompt-book), all inserted by
               Hand V (see below), among the prompt-calls: Joseph Trefusis (as ?Officer in
               I.iii, and as First Gentleman in II.i), John Totterdale (role uncertain, in
               I.iii), Barnes (as Sailor in II.i), Walmsley (as Second Senator in I.iii), John
               Freeman (as Montano in II.i), and Charles [?Ashbury] (as a Messenger in I.iii
               and as Third Gentleman in II.i).<a href="#n2" class="super">[2]</a> What appear to be
               two other names occur,  but they have been so badly shaved in binding
               as to be unidentifiable: `. . . oin' (or'. . . vin'), who played the First
               Senator in I.iii, and `. . . ick', whose role, also in I.iii, is uncertain.<a href="#n3" class="super">[3]</a>
               
            </p>
            <p>As with other Smock Alley prompt-books, the relative dating of <em>Othello</em>
               depends upon the appearance of such actors' names. Unfortunately, the evidence
               for assigning initial and terminal dates for actors appearing at Smock Alley is
               in most instances more or less conjectural, especially so because actors often
               seem to have moved back and forth between Smock Alley and the London theatres.
               W. S. Clark assigns tentative dates for five of these actors: Trefusis (c.
               1675-88), Totterdale (c. 1674-88), Barnes (c. 1675-c. 1680), Walmsley (c.
               1675-88), and Freeman (c.1675-82).<a href="#n4" class="super">[4]</a> Allan Stevenson
               first suggested the possible identification of `Charles' as Charles Ashbury, the
               son of Joseph Ashbury, himself an actor and the manager of the Smock Alley
               Theatre from 1675-1720, but we know nothing more definite about Charles than
               that he was probably associated with Smock Alley around the dates indicated by
               Clark for the other actors involved.<a href="#n5" class="super">[5]</a> Even if some
               kind of tentative dating may be suggested on the basis of these actors' names,
               such dating would probably give us only a <em>terminus ad quem,</em> since there
               is evidence that the <em>Othello</em> prompt-book may have been used for at
               least one earlier production before these particular actors took part in the
               play.<a href="#n6" class="super">6</a>
               
            </p>
            <p>Only one of the actors named, John Freeman, may perhaps help to set certain
               probable limits for dating the <em>Othello</em> promptbook, at least in so far
               as his connection with the production is concerned. Clark's dating for Freeman,
               as noted above, is "c.  1675-82," but in the light of more complete
               information now furnished by <em>The London Stage </em>(Part 1: 1660-1700)<a href="#n7" class="super">[7]</a> it can now be shown that Freeman was performing in
               London at Dorset Garden in December 1680 (1680-81 season), November 1681
               (1681-82 season), and December 1683 (1683-84 season), but does not appear in
               London again until March 1686 (1685-86 season). This would seem to leave three
               probable dates for the appearance of his name in the <em>Othello</em>
               prompt-book: (1) prior to 1680, (2) the 1682-83 season, and (3) the 1684-85
               season.<a href="#n8" class="super">[8]</a>
               
            </p>
            <p>A choice between these three possibilities may perhaps be influenced by
               consideration of the Smock Alley prompt-book (manuscript) of John Wilson's
               <em>Belphegor</em>,<a href="#n9" class="super">[9]</a> which received its first
               performance, an apparently disastrous one, in Dublin. Clark and Stevenson differ
               on the most probable date for this production, but they are agreed that the play
               was produced at Smock Alley when Wilson was himself in Dublin. Stevenson
               advances three possible periods that would satisfy this requirement: 1677-78,
               1680, and 1682-83.<a href="#n10" class="super">[10]</a> Clark advances 1677-78 as the
               date, without mentioning any other possibility.<a href="#n11" class="super">[11]</a>
               Stevenson, while admitting that 1677-78 "may have been the most suitable one,"
               believes that 1682-83 "seems more appropriate for the whole group of actors and
               fits better" with a satiric allusion,  which he dates as 1683 or
               after, to the play's failure. Among the eleven actors named in the
               <em>Belphegor</em> prompt-book, two, John Freeman and Barnes,<a href="#n12" class="super">[12]</a> also appear in <em>Othello</em>, and two other
               members of the <em>Belphegor</em> cast, George Bright and Mrs. Osborne, can,
               along with Freeman, be traced on the London stage (Dorset Garden) during some of
               the years in question. All the available evidence, detailed in the note
               below,<a href="#n13" class="super">[13]</a> tends to support Clark's claim for the
               years 1677-78. 
            </p>
            <p>The link between the <em>Othello</em> and the <em>Belphegor</em> promptbooks
               furnished by the common appearance of Freeman and Barnes in both,<a href="#n14" class="super">[14]</a> while admittedly fragile, may suggest that the  two earlier terminal dates for <em>Othello</em> (prior to 1680 or
               1682-83) are slightly more likely than the third (1684-85). Moreover, the
               absence of Trefusis in <em>Belphegor</em> and his presence in <em>Othello</em>,
               <em>Hamlet</em> (<em>c</em>. 1676-79), and <em>I Henry IV</em> (at least
               before January 1685),<a href="#n15" class="super">[15]</a> where his name is written in
               by the same hand (there Hand III) as Hand V in <em>Othello,</em> though again
               evidentially fragile, further suggests that these prompt-books may fall into a
               position after, but not long after, the <em>Belphegor</em> production, which, as
               I have shown above, may most probably be dated in 1677-78. In the first volume
               of this series, I advanced 1680-82 as a likely terminal date for the <em>Othello
                  </em>prompt-book.<a href="#n16" class="super">[16]</a> I would now, in the light of
               the fuller information on Freeman and the date of the <em>Belphegor</em>
               production, suggest a terminal date for <em>Othello</em> either shortly before
               1680 or in 1682-83, still admitting, however, what seems to me the less likely
               possibility of the 1684-85 season. 
            </p>
            <p>Before we consider further the possibility that more than one production of the
               play is represented in the <em>Othello</em> promptbook, that is, a production
               predating the insertion of the actors' names by Hand V, it will be necessary to
               discuss the main prompt-hands and, so far as possible, identify their appearance
               in the other Smock Alley prompt-books. R. C. Bald long ago noted that "as many
               as six hands are visible in the notes to <em>Othello</em>."<a href="#n17" class="super">[17]</a> There are, however, a number of notations where exact
               identification is at best uncertain and still other hands may well be
               present.<a href="#n18" class="super">[18]</a> Hand I is responsible for the advance
               prompt-calls and appears again in <em>Macbeth</em> as Hand III. Hand II gives
               the scene settings and makes occasional changes in the  text, usually
               in connection with readings found in Q1-3 and Q (1681). It occurs again in
               <em>Macbeth </em>(Hands I and II), <em>Hamlet</em> (Hands I and II),
               <em>Lear</em> (Hand b, <em>Twelfth Night </em>(Hand I), <em>Henry VIII</em>
               (Hand I) and <em>I Henry IV</em> (Hand II).<a href="#n19" class="super">[19]</a> It is,
               thus, the most ubiquitous and important hand in the Smock Alley prompt-books.
               Hand III writes in emendations in the text and is to be distinguished from Hand
               IV, which also inserts emendations, by characteristics usually associated with
               earlier seventeenth-century hands. Hand IV appears to be later than any of the
               others (?eighteenth-century) and is, like Hand II, usually associated with
               changes made in conformity with quarto readings. Neither Hand III nor IV seems
               to occur elsewhere in the Smock Alley prompt-books. Hand V, which has already
               been mentioned in connection with the vexed problem of dating, is responsible
               for all the actors' names and a number of other important prompt-notes. It
               occurs elsewhere only in <em>I Henry IV</em> (as Hand III] and, possibly (see
               note 13), in the <em>Belphegor</em> prompt-book. Hand VI inserts a number of
               prompt-notes mostly concerned with scene settings and sound effects. The same
               hand also appears in <em>Hamlet</em> (Hand III), <em>Julius Caesar </em>(acting
               list), <em>Macbeth</em> (Hand IV), <em>Merry Wives</em> (Hand I), and, perhaps,
               Wilson's <em>Belphegor</em> (main prompt-hand). 
            </p>
            <p>With the main prompt-hands now established, we may return to the question
               postponed above: Does the Smock Alley <em>Othello</em> show evidence of serving
               for more than one production of the play? Such evidence as there is would seem
               to support the view that Hand V's participation in the prompt-book may indeed
               represent a later reworking of an earlier production. Hand V supplements or
               cancels prompt-notes by other hands, but his own annotations are never
               superseded or supplemented. The beginning of II.i shows perhaps the clearest
               example of Hand V's work. His addition to (or perhaps substitution for) Hand
               II's setting (`&lt;Ca&gt;stle') of `ye Shipps' and his handling of the Folio
               three Gentlemen, whom he reduces to two, appearing to  supersede (or
               at least supplementing) Hand I's treatment, as well as his cancelation of
               prompt-notes by Hand ?III (lines 20, 49-51) and Hand VI (lines 73-74, 75), aimed
               at getting rid of the gun salutes (lines 55, 94), all strongly suggest a
               probable reworking of the scene as originally planned. But there is little here
               to tell us whether Hand V's revisions represent changes for a later separate
               production or were made as the final stage in the initial preparation of the
               prompt-book. Perhaps however, Hand V's cancellation of prompt-notes by hands
               other than Hands I and II, who may be credited with preparing the first rough
               draft of the prompt-book, may be taken as evidence that Hand V's work represents
               a distinct new production. If this is so, and I would say the evidence in II.i
               and elsewhere<a href="#n20" class="super">[20]</a> seems generally to support such a
               view, we must assign a date for the original production as somewhat earlier than
               the years associated with Hand V's intervention (i.e. shortly before 1680,
               1682-83, or possibly 1684-85). How much earlier there is no certain way of
               knowing, but the general community of prompt-hands, particularly Hand II, with
               other Smock Alley promptbooks, none of which can be shown to be earlier than
               1675, suggests a date in the later part of the 1670's. 
            </p>
            <p>The <em>Othello</em> prompt-book is, unfortunately, incomplete, lacking six pages
               (795-800, sigs. 3X5-3Y1 in F3) of the text from II.i.88 to III.iii.19 and the
               final page (817, sig.3Z4 in F3), containing the concluding lines of the play
               (V.ii.360-371), a total of 735 lines.<a href="#n21" class="super">[21]</a> The loss of
               these sections of the text makes it very difficult to determine the exact amount
               of cutting undertaken for the Smock Alley production (or productions). In  what remains of the prompt-book, roughly around 326 lines have been
               marked, by one hand or another, for omission, but we can only guess at the
               extent of the cutting in the missing pages. Of the 723 lines lost between
               II.i.88 and III.iii.19, the eighteenth-century acting texts cut somewhat over
               two hundred lines, including the whole of II.ii (the proclamation scene), III.i
               (the clown scene), and III.ii (Othello giving letters to be sent to Venice).
               Although the Clown was originally retained in the prompt-call by Hand I at the
               opening of III.iv, a later hand (Hand ?III) has deleted his entry and cut lines
               1-22.<a href="#n22" class="super">[22]</a> It seems likely, therefore, that the
               Clown's earlier appearance in III.i (some 30 lines) was also deleted at the same
               time, but whether the rest of the scene (another 28 lines) was also cut, as in
               the eighteenth-century acting texts, or retained, as in the Collier MS cutting,
               must remain uncertain. Since the amount of cutting in other parts of the Smock
               Alley <em>Othello</em> is comparatively light, we may perhaps suggest a total of
               about 95 lines cut in the missing six pages. This would give an over-all total
               of around 421 lines cut and leave a final acting version of about 2,808 lines, a
               stage text considerably longer than any found in the eighteenth-century acting
               texts and Kemble.<a href="#n23" class="super">[23]</a>
               
            </p>
            <p>Marvin Rosenberg, in his interesting stage-history, <em>The Masks of Othello</em>
               (1961), has analyzed a number of the cuts in the Smock Alley PB and finds there
               some attempt being made to "refine" both Othello and Desdemona in accordance
               with  the doctrine of decorum, citing Thomas Rymer's famous attack on
               the play and its principal characters.<a href="#n24" class="super">[24]</a> While I
               would agree that questions of decorum may play some slight part in the pattern
               of cutting, probably under the influence of Thomas Betterton's "heroic"
               conception of the role of Othello (noted by Rosenberg; see, perhaps, I.iii.273;
               III.iii.24, 180-183; IV.i.35-44, IV.ii. 56- 64, 161-165), I suspect that the
               real reason for deleting `Exchange me for a Goat' in III.iii.180-183 was more
               concerned with a desire to get rid of the difficult language in the following
               lines than with the possible indecorum in the reference to such a vulgar animal
               as a goat. In III.iii.345-357, Othello's famous "farewell" to his "occupation,"
               which is reduced to some four lines,<a href="#n25" class="super">[25]</a> it is
               possible to see "refinement" at work, perhaps, in the cutting of lines 345-347,
               but that the latter part of the speech was cut because of an over-bombastic,
               rhetorical tone, unsuitable to the heroic Othello (as Mr. Rosenberg suggests)
               seems very questionable. The speech was left untouched in eighteenth-century
               acting versions and singled out for special praise by Francis Gentleman (see the
               Collations). More simply, I think, what is behind the cutting here, and for the
               most part in the remainder of the play, is a desire to shorten the play somewhat
               by deleting what seemed to the reviser(s) non-essential lines and passages, in
               two cases perhaps under the influence of Quarto 1 (see IV.iii.22-57, 88-102).
               <a href="#n26" class="super">[26]</a> And, although one may note the occasional
               deletion of passages with special sexual reference (as in III.iii.345-347,
               IV.i.35-44, or IV.ii. 56-64), other passages equally or more explicitly sexual
               remain untouched. Moreover, although the eighteenth century completely deleted
               Othello's trance scene in IV.i, excised the character of Bianca from the play
               and Othello's brief appearance in V.i., each in its way, we may assume,
               considered  offenses against aspects of the doctrine of decorum, the
               Smock Alley PB retains them essentially uncut.<a href="#n27" class="super">[27]</a> In
               other words, decorum or refinement in eighteenth-century terms played a very
               small part in the production of the Smock Alley PB. 
            </p>
            <p>As in the other Restoration theatre versions generally, the reviser(s) at Smock
               Alley either jettisoned "hard" or obsolete words and phrases (for example,
               I.i.16; I.ii.17, 56, 89; II.i.63-65; III.iii.287; IV.ii.30) or substituted other
               readings (for example, I.i.39; I.ii.17, 22; I.iii.275; II.i.8-9; V.i.22). He (or
               they) also shows a knowledge of the earlier quarto editions, particularly Q2-3
               and possibly Q1 and Q (1681)<a href="#n28" class="super">[28]</a>(see I.i.110; I.ii.22;
               I.iii.110, 159, 261, etc.), a knowledge that argues for a close connection
               between the Smock Alley PB and the current London performances, which, according
               to the 1681 quarto, used the quarto version stemming from Q2 (1630). Since there
               was a continual exchange between the London theatres and Smock Alley, it is fair
               to assume that many of the cuts and other changes, which now appear for the
               first time in the Smock Alley PB, were in fact importations from London and that
               the Smock Alley PB preserves for us in its essentials <em>Othello</em> as it was
               performed in Restoration London. Another indication of this influence is the
               large number of cuts common to the Smock Alley PB and the eighteenth-century
               London acting versions (see the Collations), since the line of influence would
               certainly not be through Smock Alley. On the other hand, the Smock Alley PB has
               a substantial number of cuts (for example, I.ii.19-24; I.iii. 83-87; II.i.36-42;
               III.iii.351-357) and some twenty-eight readings (I.i.39, 159; I.ii.12, 17;
               I.iii.59, 258, 264, 274, 279, 374; II.i.8-9, 10, 34 (<em>bis</em>), 53, 56-57,
               59, 60,66-67; III.iii.135, 137,393,455,478; IV.i.22; IV.ii.74; V.i. 14, 22)
               which are either unique or anticipate later editorial emendations. There is, of
               course, no way of determining whether at least some of these cuts or readings
               are really peculiar to Smock Alley or whether they represent details of the
               London tradition that failed to leave their mark on later stage practice.

            <p>The stage settings used for the Smock Alley <em>Othello</em> seem to be almost
               entirely stock scenes, all but one (`ye Shipps' II.i) being employed at least
               once in other Smock Alley Shakespeare  prompt-books.<a href="#n29" class="super">[29]</a> They are: `Towne' (I.i); `Presence' (I.iii, IV.ii

                     roles of Peto and Page in <em>II Henry IV</em>. Gunnar Sorelius discovered
                     twenty-seven cuttings (from the Smock Alley Third Folio) of <em>I Henry
                        IV</em> and twenty-four of <em>II Henry IV</em> in the
                     Halliwell-Phillipps' scrapbooks in the Shakespeare Memorial Library in
                     Stratford-upon-Avon (<em>I Henry IV</em>: Vols. I-III, VI, IX; <em>II Henry
                        IV:</em> Vols. III-VI) and has published an account of what remains of
                     these Smock Alley prompt-books (including the earlier known single fragment
                     of <em>I Henry IV</em> in the Folger Shakespeare Library) in the
                     <em>Shakespeare Quarterly</em> ("The Smock Alley Prompt-Books of
                     <em>I</em> and <em>2 Henry IV</em>," XXII (1971), 111-128). In addition
                     to the appearance of `Charles' in <em>II Henry IV</em>, Trefusis played the
                     First Carrier in II.i of <em>I Henry IV</em> and Powell (perhaps George
                     Powell, son of Martin Powell, also an actor, who, with his father, appears
                     with the United Company in 1686-87), the Second Carrier. From the Folger
                     fragment it was already known that Longmore (who continued to play at Smock
                     Alley into the eighteenth century) played the Chamberlain in II.i and II.ii.
                     In the <em>dramatis personae </em>list for <em>II Henry IV</em> in the Third
                     Folio (sig. 212<em>v</em>) Sorelius found the names of the actors
                     who played the `Irregular Humorists': Poins by `Shepheard', Falstaff by
                     `Baker', Bardolph by `Eales', Pistol by `Gilbert', `Charles', as already
                     noted, playing Peto and Boy. Except for `Charles', none of these names
                     appears elsewhere in the Smock Alley prompt-books. Francis Baker has long
                     been known to have played Falstaff at Smock Alley before 1685, but this is
                     the first evidence tying him directly to the role. Of the others, apart
                     perhaps from `Charles' [?Ashbury] nothing is known.

                  <p>8. We are forced to work with such evidence as we possess, but it
                     should be pointed out that these dates are less definite than they might
                     seem for two special reasons: (1) because an actor can be shown to have
                     taken part in a performance during a given season does not mean that he (or
                     she) necessarily remained with the company throughout the season (he may
                     have acted elsewhere, Smock Alley, for example); (2) on the other hand, the
                     fact that his name is not associated with say the Duke's Company, or later
                     the United Company (from the 1682-83 season on), for other performances (or
                     indeed for any performances) during a particular season does not mean that
                     he did not act various unrecorded roles during that season, since our
                     records of the personnel of the London companies for any given year depend
                     most frequently upon occasional theatre documents and actor lists (printed
                     or manuscript) attached to published versions of the plays performed. More
                     often than not we simply do not know who performed in the bulk of the
                     productions for the season in question.

                     pages in the prompt-book). Of Barnes, who was introduced as a `Boy' to sing
                     a single lyric, (his part as a Sailor in <em>Othello</em> is even slighter,
                     four lines), nothing is really known, although Clark (p. 207) gives "c.
                     1675-C. 1680" as the span of his acting career at Smock Alley. The only
                     evidence for these dates is Clark's dating of <em>Belphegor</em> in 1677-78,
                     a date which I am inclined to accept (see discussion above). All we know
                     further is that a `Mr. Barns' (or `Barnes') turns up as a member of the
                     United Company in London in the seasons of 1689-90 and 1690-91, at which
                     times at least six other actors formerly associated with Smock Alley are
                     also members of the company.

                     Van Lennep, 1965) furnishes the following information: (1) George Bright
                     first appears on the London stage (Dorset Garden) in 1678-79 (April 1679),
                     then in 1679-80 (June 1680), 1681-82 (November 1681; January 1682), 1682-83
                     (November 1682; May 1683), 1683-84 (December 1683; March 1684); (2) Mrs.
                     Osborne first appears on the London stage (Dorset Garden) in 1671-72
                     (September 1671; January 1672; August 1672), then in 1672-73 (November 1672;
                     March 1673; May 1673); 1674-75 (November 1674), 167576 (July 1676), 1677-78,
                     (September 1677),1679-80 (February, 1680), 1681-82 (November 1681, twice;
                     January 1682) 1682-83 (May 1683), 1684-85 (August 1685). This evidence,
                     coupled with that on Freeman, suggests that the second and third dates for
                     the <em>Belphegor</em> production are unlikely, first, because, though
                     Bright and Mrs. Osborne appear to have been absent from the London stage in
                     1680-81, Freeman was performing at Dorset Garden in those years (December
                     1680 and January 1681); and, second, because, though Freeman was apparently
                     available for Smock Alley in 1682-83, Bright and Mrs. Osborne (Bright
                     particularly) were acting in London during that season. We are left,
                     therefore, with the earliest proposed date (1677-78). For this date the
                     evidence as far as Freeman and Bright are concerned is negative (i.e., there
                     is no record of their performance in London at this time), but Mrs.
                     Osborne's London record shows that she could have been playing at Smock
                     Alley at any time between October 1677 and January 1679.

                  <p>14. Apart from the appearance of Freeman and Barnes in both casts
                     there are perhaps two other slender connecting links between the
                     <em>Othello</em> and <em>Belphegor</em> prompt-books: (1) the main
                     prompt-hand in <em>Belphegor</em> may be the same as Hand VI in
                     <em>Othello</em> (I am much less sure of this than I was formerly, see
                     Vols. I and IV of this series, pp. 17 and 3 respectively); (2) in both
                     instances where Barnes' name appears in the prompt-calls in
                     <em>Belphegor</em> (pp. 36, 37), it appears to be inserted by a hand
                     different from the main prompt-hand. This second hand may be, though again I
                     cannot be sure, the same as Hand V in <em>Othello </em>the hand responsible
                     for Barnes' and the other actors' names, where Hand V also inserts an
                     actor's name into another hand's advance call (see I.ii.79-82, I.iii.
                     (opening), II.i.1-5).

                     Baker, who played Falstaff (see note 2), was in London by 1683. He
                     interpreted literally a misprint in the actors' list of Edward Ravenscroft's
                     <em>Dame Dobson</em> (1684; acted May 1683 at Dorset Garden) that
                     assigned the role of Mrs. Francis to `Mr. Baker' instead of, as properly, to

                     quarto edition of <em>Othello</em> (see the Collations) is perhaps
                     suggestive but does not in itself rule out a date before 1681 for the
                     version of the Smock Alley PB connection with Hand V. There is possibly some
                     influence of Q(1681) at III.iii.135, where its error might lead to Hand II's
                     unique emendation.

                  <p>19. I have come to the belated conclusion that Hands I and II in
                     <em>Hamlet</em> and <em>Macbeth</em>, Hand I in <em>Lear</em>,
                     <em>Twelfth Night</em>, and <em>Henry VIII</em>, and Hand II in
                     <em>Othello </em>and <em>I Henry IV</em> are in fact all the same hand.
                     This conclusion, of course, vitiates my treatment of this hand in the Smock
                     Alley <em>Hamlet </em>and <em>Macbeth</em> prompt-books (Vols. IV and V) of
                     this series and telescopes what, in the General Introduction (Vol. I, p.
                     17), I called Hands A and C. I should also <em></em> add here that what I treat
                     as Hands III and VII in <em>Hamlet</em> are, I now believe, a single hand. I
                     apologize for what I now consider to be these serious errors, but anyone who
                     has tried to disentangle seventeenth-century hands, especially prompt-book
                     hands, will, I trust, feel more sorrow than anger.

                     only be guessed at, it seems highly likely that the agent of loss here, as
                     elsewhere in the Smock Alley prompt-books, was Halliwell-Phillipps. Since
                     the last page of <em>Othello</em> (817) in F3 was the recto of the first
                     page (818) of <em>Antony and Cleopatra,</em> it is almost certain, when the
                     Smock Alley F3 was broken up by Halliwell-Phillipps and the plays bound
                     separately, that this page was included with <em>Antony and Cleopatra</em>
                     (now lost). The Smock Alley <em>Macbeth</em> and <em>Hamlet</em> offer an
                     exactly analogous case (see Vol. V, Part i, p. I of this series). The other
                     six missing pages (795-800) were most probably either (1) detached for
                     special exhibition purposes and never reassembled (compare the treatment of
                     four leaves in the Smock Alley <em>Macbeth</em>) or (2) cut up into
                     fragments and pasted into one of Halliwell-Phillipps' many scrapbooks
                     (compare the scandalous treatment of the Smock Alley <em>I</em> and <em>II
                        Henry IV </em>referred to above in Note 2). Someday, we may still hope,
                     all four leaves may be recovered. Professor Gunnar Sorelius (see note 1) has
                     kindly assured me that the missing leaves are not lurking in the Stratford
                     or Folger Halliwell-Phillipps' scrapbooks.

                     Lane in January of 1675. So far as I know, there is no evidence of his

                     throughout in matters of staging, cutting, additions, etc. with five
                     eighteenth-century acting versions and one from the early nineteenth
                     century, as well as with the Collier MS (see the Collations). Using Alfred
                     Hart's figure of 3,229 as the total number of lines in an uncut
                     <em>Othello</em> text (<em>R.E.S.</em>, VIII [1932], 21), we may offer
                     the following rough estimates of comparative length: Smock Alley PB, 2,808
                     (cutting 421 lines); 1755 Witford edition (Covent Garden), 2,384 (cutting
                     845); John Palmer PB for 1766 (in a copy of the Hitch-Hawes 1761 edition),
                     2,363 (cutting 866); anonymous 1755 PB (in a copy of the Witford 1755
                     edition), 2,266 (cutting 963); 1764 Garland-Exshaw edition (Drury Lane),
                     2,315 (cutting 914); Bell's acting edition (Drury Lane, 1773), 2,429
                     (cutting 800); J. P. Kemble's acting edition (Covent Garden, 1804), 2,539
                     (cutting 690). Occasional references are made to a 1770 acting edition with
                     Drury Lane and Covent Garden casts for 65 and to the R. Butters edition (c.
                     1788; Covent Garden). The Collier MS (in a copy of the Second Folio, 1632)
                     suggests cutting only about 293 lines in all, 83 of these falling in the
                     central missing section of the Smock Alley PB.

                     <em>Othello</em> might have had some direct influence on the cutting in
                     the Smock Alley PB. Considering the date of the Smock Alley PB (not later
                     than 1684-85) and the date of Rymer's critique in <em>A Short View of
                        Tragedy</em> (1692), any such direct influence seems impossible. See
                     also an earlier article by Rosenberg on <em>Othello</em> on the
                     eighteenth-century stage in <em>SP,</em> LI (1954), 75-94.

                     necessary connection with Q1. The scene is even more heavily cut in the
                     eighteenth-century acting texts and Kemble (see Collations).

                     about these actors. Presumably, the actors here named are to play the
                     characters entering at the beginning of scene iii. `&lt; &gt;oin' and
                     `&lt;W&gt;almsly' can be assigned as `1. <em>Sen</em>.' and `2.
                     <em>Sen</em>.' and probably Trefusis as the Officer (at 12). This
                     would seem to leave `&lt;Totterd&gt;ell' as the Duke, but such an
                     assignment for Totterdale at this point in his career would seem
                     unlikely. Clark (<em>Early Irish Stage</em>, 1955, p. 76) gives
                     Totterdale the role of an officer, but the order of the PB entry would
                     seem to support Trefusis' claim to that role. Perhaps, however, the
                     `&amp;c:'after Trefusis' name implies that he and others came on to
                     "swell the scene" as other Senators and Officers. Whether the mysterious
                     `&lt; &gt;ick' should be interpreted as the remains of an actor's name
                     is not at all certain. Under other circumstances I would propose
                     `&lt;mus&gt;ick', but there seems no reason to open scene iii with music

                     Possible reasons for the loss of these leaves are discussed in the

                     cutting, or other changes, made in PB. See the Introduction, pp. 7-8,
                     for further discussion. 18th-century acting texts and Kemble omit, among
                     other smaller cuts, II.i.125-145 (`Come . . . best.'), 229-253 (`When

                     (the clown scene), and III.ii (Othello giving letters to be sent to
                     Venice); in addition, Palmer PB cuts II.iii.1-11 (omitting the entrance
                     of Othello and Desdemona and bringing Cassio on at 11 with Iago) and,
                     1755 PB cuts II.i 94-96 (`<em>Within</em>.] A sail . . . news.').
                     Collier MS cuts about 83 lines in all, including II.i. 125-146 (`me?
                     <em>Iago</em>. I am . . . indeed?') and III.i.1-31. On the omission
                     of III.i, Gentleman (Bell) remarks: "<em>Shakespeare</em> has furnished,
                     at the beginning of the third act, a very trifling, non-essential scene,
                     of two pages, to gratify the peculiar taste of <em>his</em> audiencies
                     [<em>sic</em>], but which is now most justly rejected, the act
                     beginning much better here [i.e. III.iii]." Gentleman, however, objects
                     to the omission of II.iii. 205-207 (`My blood . . . way.'), commenting:
                     "We think, the following lines of the original should be retained, as
                     beautiful and significant."; they were restored in Kemble.

                     Hand I's call at III.iii.424-427, where `Clown' has been later crossed
                     through by ?Hand V). Then some other hand has marked, by circling, 1-37
                     for cutting, including the opening s.d., an arrangement that makes no
                     sense, as Hand I had recognized by calling for Othello's entrance at 31
                     (F [i.e., F3] wrongly enters Othello after 37). The next step seems to
                     be the deletion of 1-22, by crisscrossing, with a line added below 22.
                     The same hand then wrote `Cut out' (right of left rule opposite F
                     opening s.d.), and `Cut' (left of left rule opposite F 23), deleted (by
                     circling) F `<em>and Clown</em>.' in opening s.d., and crossed through F
                     `<em>Exit Clo</em>.' at 22. The scene thus begins with the entrance
                     of Desdemona and Emilia at 23, contrary to Hand I's original intention.
                     The identity of the hand here involved is uncertain (Hand ?VI), but it
                     is the same hand, presumably, that writes in `Enter 0th' to left of
                     center rule at 31. Hand VI places `Chamber/ Here', to left of center
                     rule, preceded by a crossed line opposite 24. At the same time Hand VI
                     deletes Hand II's `Chamber.', to left of center rule, below 38 and
                     following F `<em>Enter Othello</em>.' (also crossed through by Hand ?I).
                     Hand IV at some point in this process places `[line] / Stent / [line]',
                     to left of center rule, opposite 29. The final intentions are clear, but
                     the order in which the various notations were made is uncertain. 1755,
                     Bell give the setting as `<em>an Apartment in the same Castle</em>';
                     1764, as `<em>another Apartment in the same Palace</em>' 
                     (following Theobald); Kemble, as `<em>Another Apartment in the
                        Castle</em>'; Palmer PB adds below the 1755 setting `<a href="images/.jpg"><img src="images/.gif" alt=""></a>
                     Wainsc: cham: 2<em>d.</em> gr.' and exits Emilia after 33,
                     re-entering her at 99; PB also uses the whistle symbol for a change of
                     scene. 18th-century acting texts and Kemble begin the scene (as in PB)
                     at 23; so also Collier MS.

                     18th-century acting texts (except Palmer PB) give the setting as `<em>a
                        Court before the Palace</em>' (following Theobald); Palmer PB notes
                     `Continue SCENE' (i.e. the `Wainsc: cham:' of III.iv; 1755 PB also
                     implies no change of scene); Kemble gives `<em>An Apartment in the
                        Castle</em>'. 18th-century acting texts cut the opening parts of
                     this scene heavily: 1755 cuts 26-29 (`. . . blab.'), 35-36 (`we say . .
                     . be-lye her.'), 37-210 (`Handkerchiffe . . . no body.'); Palmer PB
                     (including the cuts in 1755) also cuts 3-8 (`Or . . . Heaven.'), 23 (`I:
                     . . . now. ), 36-37 (`that's fulsome:'); 1755 PB and Kemble cut
                     everything through 215; 1764 cuts 3-8 (`Or . . . Heaven.'), 23 (`I: . .
                     . now.'), 26-29 (`. . . blab.'), 34-215 (`With her? . . . fouler.');
                     Bell cuts as in 1764, except for the last cut, which in Bell is 35-210
                     (`lie on her? . . . no body.'). Gentleman (Bell) has two notes on the
                     beginning of Act IV: "It does <em>Shakespeare</em> great service to
                     begin the Fourth Act here, as the six original pages which precede, are
                     tedious, confused, trifling, and often indecent: the Moor has already
                     been sufficiently wrought on; besides, the character of
                     <em>Othello</em>, as it now stands, is as much as very great spirit and
                     acting powers can go through; more must sink the ablest performer." And:
                     "We think beginning the Act at this line [216] would save delicacy a
                     blush or two, and be, in that sense, an improvement." The first note is
                     attached to the beginning of the scene and is confusing, since Bell
                     begins with line 1 (see above for the cutting in Bell).
