            <h1> Smock Alley <br>King Lear <br>Third Folio <br>Introduction 
            </h1>
            <p>ALTHOUGH the Smock Alley provenience of this <em>King Lear</em> prompt-book (PB), based
               on a copy of the Third Folio (F) text, is proved by the appearance in it of two
               prompt-hands common to some other seventeenth-century Smock Alley prompt-books (see
               below), no exact dating limits, in the absence of any actors names among the prompt
               notations, can be suggested. There is, however, one peculiar feature of the <em>Lear</em>
               PB that makes it probable that the production for which it was prepared, though almost
               certainly before 1700, was after 1681, the year in which Nahum Tate's notorious but
               long-lived adaptation of Shakespeare's play was first acted and published.<a href="#n1" class="super"> [1]</a> Tate, among other less radical "improvements," invented a love
               affair between Cordelia and Edgar (thus eliminating Cordelia's marriage to the French
               king), cut out the role of the Fool (not restored until 1838), and, in a "happy"
               denouement, turned the play from a tragedy into a kind of tragicomedy by allowing Lear,
               Cordelia, and Gloucester to remain alive: Lear and Gloucester, 
                along with Kent, totter off to 'some cool Cell' to
               reflect on 'our Fortunes past, / Cheer'd with relation of the prosperous Reign / Of this
               celestial Pair [Cordelia and Edgar]'. The Smock Alley prompt-book shows no evidence,
               structural or verbal, of influence from Tate's version until the final scene (V.iii). At
               this point all advance character calls suddenly cease, the last such call being for Edgar
               and Gloucester (at V.i.54) in preparation for their entry at the beginning of V.ii. The
               cessation of advance calls at this particular point suggests, strongly, I think, despite a
               few cuts by Hand II in V.iii, that Hand I (see below) intended to conclude the play with a
               somewhat adapted version of Tate's "happy ending." Bizarre, even unlikely, as this may
               sound, it is, in fact, exactly what George Colman concocted (except for much heavier
               cutting, some occasional Tateification, and the omission of the Fool) in his alteration of
               <em>Lear</em> first performed in 1768, restoring Cordelia's marriage to the French king
               and omitting Tate's sentimental love business between Cordelia and Edgar.<a href="#n2" class="super"> [2]</a>
               
            </p>
            <p> Three hands can clearly be distinguished in the Lear PB, two prompt-hands and a third
               intrusive late eighteenth-century hand. Hand I, which appears also in the Smock Alley
               <em>Hamlet</em> (Hands I and II)<a href="#n3" class="super"> [3]</a>
               <em>Macbeth</em> (Hands I and II), <em>Twelfth Night</em> (Hand I), <em>Henry VIII</em>
               (Hand I), <em>Othello</em> (Hand II), and <em>I Henry IV</em> (Hand II), is responsible
               for the scene notations, the advance character calls and sound effects, and for the
               restoration of two cuts made by Hand II. Hand II, which appears also in the Smock Alley
               <em>Henry VIII</em> (Hand II) and perhaps in <em>Hamlet</em> (Hand V) initially (i.e.,
               before Hand I's work) went through the play circling lines, phrases, and single words for
               cutting, occasionally substituting new readings for words that struck him as archaic or
               "hard." Hand III, which also meddled in the Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em> (Hand IV),
               <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em> (Hand II), <em>Twelfth Night</em> (Hand II), and<em>
                  Merry Wives of Windsor</em> (Hand II), inserts emended readings drawn from
               eighteenth-century editors from Rowe (1709) through Jennens (1770),<a href="#n4" class="super">
                  [4]</a> as well as a number 
                of apparently original readings.<a href="#n5" class="super">
                  [5]</a> There is no reason to think that Hand III has any connection with the
               prompt-book's earlier Smock Alley provenience. Hand III's work disappears after II.iv.
               What may be a fourth hand (though possibly Hand I) may be responsible for the emended
               reading at III.i.22-25. 
            </p>
            <p> The <em>Lear</em> PB is very lightly cut. Of the roughly 2,920 lines in the Folio text,
               Hand II marks for deletion only 123 lines and 40 half-lines (plus a few phrases and single
               words), and Hand I restores 11 of those lines, leaving a play (taking the 40 half-lines as
               equivalent to 20 lines) of roughly 2,777 lines,<a href="#n6" class="super"> [6]</a> comparable in
               length to the Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em> (2,806) and <em>Othello</em> (2,808), the later
               theatre texts of David Garrick (2,318; first acted 1756; first printed in John Bell's
               <em>Shakespeare's Plays, As they are now performed at the Theatres Royal in London</em>
               , Vol. II, 1773), George Colman (2,171; first acted and printed 1768), and John Philip
               Kemble (2,009; first acted and printed 1795, here consulted in Mrs. Inchbald's <em>British
                  Theatre</em> , Vol. IV, 1808).<a href="#n7" class="super"> [7]</a>
               
            </p>
            <p> Except for the postulated substitution of some form of Tate's "happy ending," discussed
               above, the Smock Alley <em>Lear</em> (discounting Hand III's much later meddling) shows no
               significant points of contact, verbally or in cutting, with either Tate's adaptation 
                or the three acting texts referred to above, and they
               share with the prompt-book only a single scene setting (at IV.vii). All settings are stock
               and appear in other Smock Alley promptbooks.<a href="#n8" class="super"> [8]</a>
               
            </p>
            <p> Certain characteristics of the <em>Lear</em> PB may perhaps suggest that, like the Smock
               Alley <em>Midsummer Night's Dream, Comedy of Errors</em> , and <em>Winter's Tale</em> , it
               was laid aside and never reached actual production: (1) the absence of actors' names among
               the prompt notes (contrast the Smock Alley <em>Macbeth, Hamlet, Othello, Henry VIII,</em>
               and <em>I</em> and <em>2 Henry I V</em> ); <a href="#n9" class="super"> [9]</a> (2) the failure
               of Hand I (or some other hand) to insert advance warnings for a number of sound effects
               called for by the Folio stage directions (see <em>Sound effects</em> ); and (3) the
               absence of secondary cutting (contrast Smock Alley <em>Macbeth, Hamlet,</em> and
               <em>Othello</em> ).<a href="#n10" class="super"> [10]</a> Although none of these points is
               necessarily conclusive against stage production, the second being the strongest, taken
               together they leave the final status of the <em>Lear</em> PB to some degree at least
               questionable. 
            </p>
            <div class="note" id="n1">
               <p> 1. In any event, since only two London performances of Shakespeare's
                  <em>Lear</em> , which was assigned to the Duke's Company in 1660, are recorded (1664/65
                  and 1675) before Tate's 1681 adaptation and since Smock Alley tended to take its cue from
                  London successes, it is probably unlikely that <em>Lear</em> would have been seriously
                  considered for production before 1681. 
               </p>

            <div class="note" id="n2">
               <p> 2. In 1823 Edmund Kean reversed Colman's arrangement and tacked Shakespeare's
                  tragic denouement (V.iii) onto a text that was basically pure Tate, including the
                  Cordelia-Edgar love affair. For Kean's acting text, see Cumberland's <em>British
                     Theatre</em> , Vol. VI (1826).

               <p> 3. In Vol. VI: Part i, of this series, p. 4, note 19, I declared that the
                  hands described as A and C (see the General Introduction, Vol. I: Part i, of this series,
                  p. 17) were in fact a single hand. I have allowed this decision to stand, but I should
                  warn the reader that I am no longer entirely convinced that Hands A and C should be
                  treated as one. 
               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="note" id="n4">
               <p> 4. See Vol. I: Part i, of this series, pp. 15-16. I there described Hand III
                  as mid-eighteenth century, but the <em>Lear</em> PB shows that Hand III worked on the
                  Smock Alley prompt-books, or at least on this prompt-book, sometime after 1770, since he
                  appears to make use of Charles Jennens' edition of <em>Lear</em> published in that year.
                  Jennens was the first editor to publish a record of most of the Qq variants and the
                  emendations of editors from Rowe through Johnson (Capell's similar record, though compiled
                  earlier than Jennens', was not published until 1779). Five of Hand III's readings are
                  peculiar to Hanmer's text, which was first published in 1743 (I.i.15, II.i. 94, 97, 111
                  [not included in the collations], and II.i.70-74 [see <em>Textual cuts</em> ]), but Hand
                  III may have picked them up from Jennens' textual notes. 
               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="note" id="n5">
               <p> 5. Three of Hand III's readings (II.i.96 [see <em>Textual cuts</em> ], 99
                  [see <em>Textual changes</em> ], 125 [see <em>Textual cuts</em> ]) appear elsewhere only
                  in the so-called Collier MS (see J. P. Collier's <em>Notes and Emendations</em> , 1852)
                  and in Collier's 1853 edition (the third reading was later adopted by Alexander Schmidt,
                  1879). Since the Collier MS (i.e., manuscript readings, supposedly contemporary, inserted
                  in what is known as the Perkins Second Folio [1632] by Collier himself) is a
                  mid-nineteenth-century forgery, it is tempting, though coincidence is barely possible, to
                  suppose that Collier had had access to the Smock Alley Third Folio (1663/64) and purloined
                  these three readings from the <em>Lear</em> PB. Collier may also have taken a hint from
                  Hand III's reading at I.i.230 (see <em>Textual changes</em> ).

               <p> 6. My line-count is based on Alfred Hart's total (with allowance made for the
                  Folio text) of 3,205 lines for Lear (see <em>Review of English Studies</em> , 8 [1932],
                  21) The total of 2,777 for the Lear PB like the following totals for <em>Hamlet,
                     Othello</em> , Tate's adaptation, and the three theatre versions, is, given the
                  considerable amount of prose in these texts, necessarily somewhat of a rough estimate.

                  advance call for 'Knight' is inserted at I.iv.14, following an advance call for
                  'stew(ard)' at 8 above. Since the Steward (i.e., Oswald) enters at 48 and, after a
                  half-line, exits, and the Knight's first speech comes at 54, he is presumably meant to
                  enter immediately after the Steward's exit. It is possible, however, that Hand I
                  intended the advance call to mark the Knight's reentry at 5: (as in edited texts since
                  Dyce, who exits him at 51), thus treating the Knight as being among the
                  '<em>Attendants</em> ' called for in the F s.d. at 7. The missing advance call for
                  Edgar to enter at V. .37 was probably on the torn-off left corner of F p. 784. There is
                  no advance call anticipating the F s.d. at the opening of V.ii, which brings Lear and
                  Cordelia's army '<em>over the Stage, &amp; Exeunt.'</em>, although there is an advance
                  call for Edgar and Gloucester, who enter immediately after this F s.d., at V.i.54 (but
                  no call for Edgar's reentry at V.ii.4). Advance calls cease with V.ii. For the probable
                  implications of this lack of further advance calls by Hand I, see the Introduction, p.
                  1.

                     Jennens (or perhaps by Capell, who first inserted 'ay' in 73 [from Qq] before F

                  <p>Both Hands II and III are responsible for a number of verbal changes in the F text.
                     Of Hand II's comparatively few changes, all but one are unique to PB (see I.i.191) and
                     are limited (except for the alteration of two speech-prefixes) to substituting
                     commonplace words for words that by 
                      the closing decades of the seventeenth century
                     were considered either archaic or "hard." Hand III, from I.i through II.iv, frequently
                     emends the F text by inserting, usually with a caret, (1) corrections of F's obvious
                     errors (some of these small corrections may, indeed, be the work of Hand II); (2) a
                     few short phrases from the Qq (first introduced into the basic F1 text by Pope); (3)
                     other editorial emendations derived from the editions of Rowe (1709) through Jennens
                     (1770); (4) a few adjustments of lineation and punctuation, also derived from
                     eighteenth-century editions; and (5) a sizable number of emendations that are unique
                     to Hand III (in addition to two [I.i.230; II.i.99] shared only with the Collier MS;
                     see also <em>Textual cuts</em>, II.i.96, 125). Since there is no evidence to suggest
                     that Hand III's doctoring of the text has any connection with PB's Smock Alley
                     provenience, only the readings in category (5), and a few of special interest in
                     categories (3) and (4), have been included in the following collation.

                     metrical reasons, reads 'Say will you have her?'). <strong>279</strong>
