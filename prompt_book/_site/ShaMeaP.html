            <h1>Introduction<br>
               <em>Measure for Measure</em>: Padua<br> First Folio 
            </h1>
            <p>In the General Introduction I have advanced reasons for considering a date
               between 1625 and 1635 for the Padua First Folio prompt-book of <em>Measure for
                  Measure</em>. I also claimed for it some connection, together with the other
               two Padua prompt-books, with Sir Edward Dering's group of amateur actors and
               discussed the bearing which this association with Sir Edward had on the relation
               of these prompt-books to the public stage.<a href="#n1" class="super">1</a> Unlike the
               Padua prompt-books of <em>Macbeth</em> and <em>The Winter's Tale</em>, the
               prompt-book of <em>Measure for Measure</em> does not contain any actors' names
               or initials, but the hand responsible for making the prompt-notations, and most
               probably the deletions, is the same as that in <em>Macbeth</em>. 
            </p>
            <p>Although much more has been cut by the reviser in <em>Measure for Measure</em>
               than in <em>Macbeth</em>, the treatment of the play as a whole is more
               conservative.<a href="#n2" class="super">2</a> Something under 579 lines (since
               this figure includes half-lines) have been cut; as in <em>Macbeth</em>, much of
               the cutting seems to have been aimed at shortening
                the principal roles (see the notes on
               II.iv.9-17 and V.i.112-114). These cuts leave a play of about 2,081 lines,<a href="#n3" class="super">3</a> comparable in length to the 2,134 lines of the Tonson
               (1722) acting text, the 2,013 lines of the Bell version, and the 2,037 lines of
               the Inchbald version.<a href="#n4" class="super">4</a> In Tonson, Bell, and Inchbald,
               however, the cutting is more concerned with removing certain of the low-comedy
               scenes and with the usual eighteenth-century process of `refinement,' less
               concerned with shortening the leading roles. 
            </p>
            <p>The longer cuts (18 lines or more) are as follows: </p>
            <p>I.ii.7-44 (conversation between Lucio and the two Gentlemen). Tonson and Bell
               were even more severe on this scene, omitting everything down through 119.
               Inchbald retains a substantial part of the opening lines, including those of
               Mistress Overdone and Pompey, but reverses the order of scenes ii and iii.
               D'Avenant dispenses entirely with Mistress Overdone, Pompey (except as the
               `Fool' in Acts IV and V), Elbow, Froth, etc. throughout his version. 
            </p>
            <p>II.i.230-265 (dialogue between Escalus and Pompey). D'Avenant, Tonson, and Bell
               omit. Inchbald preserves 258 (`I advise . . .') -267 as part of a separate scene
               following II.ii. 
            </p>
            <p>III.i.21-39 (part of the Duke's speech on death). D'Avenant cuts the whole
               speech; Tonson, 23-35 (`Thou . . . Moon.'); Bell, 19-21 (`Thou . . . dust.'),
               35-36 (`and . . . palsied-Eld:'); Inchbald, 17-21 (`Thou . . . dust.'), 23-32
               (`Thou . . . sooner.'). 
            </p>
            <p>III.ii.43-89 (conversation in which Pompey tries to persuade Lucio to go bail for
               him). This considerable cut would have partly satisfied the editor of Bell,
               Francis Gentleman, who (p. 314) thinks the whole scene, down to line 90, "low
               ribaldry, too insignificant to make even an upper gallery laugh; and too
               indecent to bear." Indeed Gentleman later (p. 318) suggests beginning the scene
               at 209. Nevertheless it was mostly retained in performance (also in Inchbald),
               somewhat shortened and bowdlerized. The PB reviser does not seem to have been
               concerned with the moral implications of the lines at all; at least he makes no
               attempt to chasten Lucio's later speeches in this scene. Tonson cuts 42, 48-55
               (`for . . . worse?'); Bell, 42, 48-55 (`for . . . worse?'), 58-63
               ('<em>Clo</em>. Troth . . . so.'), 83; Inchbald, 35-42 (`he . . . sir'), 47-63
               (`What . . . so.'), 66-72 (`for . . . borne.') .
               
               
            </p>
            <p>III.ii.197-218 (scene in which Mistress Overdone is sent to prison by Escalus).
               This cut gets rid of the Bawd's role here entirely. D'Avenant cuts all this
               material; Bell and Inchbald also omit the Bawd, cutting 200-218 (`But . . .
               words.'). 
            </p>
            <p>III.ii.276-296 (the Duke's rhymed moralizing). Part of the general reduction in
               D'Avenant; Tonson, Bell, and Inchbald cut 277-278 (`Pattern . . . go:'), 287-290
               (`How . . . ?'). Most modern readers would consider this speech a natural cut,
               but Gentleman (Bell, p. 320) thinks otherwise: "The sentiments of this soliloquy
               are just and instructive." 
            </p>
            <p>IV.iii.4-21 (Pompey's list of Mistress Overdone's customers). Inchbald cuts as in
               PB; D'Avenant, Tonson, and Bell omit 1-21. 
            </p>
            <p>It will be noticed that only two of these longer cuts are aimed at reducing the
               major roles (III.i.21-39 and III.ii.276-296); most of the cutting affecting
               these roles is accounted for by the large number (86 in all) of short scattered
               deletions (see particularly V.i). Not infrequently, as one might expect, the
               heart has been cut out of some of the most poetically famous speeches in the
               play (e.g., I.i.28-43; II.ii.109-125, 166-172; II.iv.9-17, 159-167; III.i.21-39;
               IV.iv.23-30); and in this respect the Padua prompt-book is rather more culpable
               than the eighteenth-century versions. 
            </p>
            <p>No attempt has been made to reduce the number of characters, nor are any changes
               made in the assignment of speeches. There is also little to comment on in the
               matter of stage business. The handling of what modern texts from Pope on,
               including Bell and Inchbald, call Scene ii of Act III follows the Folio
               arrangement by which the Duke remains on stage, with no change of scene implied.
               Pope is the first to introduce a change of scene here, from `<em>The
                  Prison</em>' to `<em>The Street</em>'. Rowe and Tonson retain the Folio
               arrangement. We may also notice the early entrance for the Provost and others in
               I.ii, at line 114, an arrangement which appears to ignore the Folio scene break
               (uncancelled, however) and agrees with Rowe's later handling of the scene.
               Moreover the reviser-prompter's delay in Lucio's entrance also anticipates Bell
               and Inchbald. 
            </p>
            <p>Two prompt-warnings are of special significance inasmuch as they support a
               pre-Restoration date for the Padua 
               prompt-books. At IV.iii we find `Bee ready Abhorson' and at V.i.259, `Bee
               ready'. I have not found this particular form of imperative warning in
               Restoration prompt-books, but it is to be found occasionally in prompt-books
               belonging to the second and third decades of the century.<a href="#n5" class="super">5</a> The `florish' added at the opening of V.i may also be
               significant.<a href="#n6" class="super">6</a>
               
            </p>
            <p>The following characteristics of the prompt-book may be noticed:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>a. A single hand is responsible for all prompt-notations and calls. The
                  same hand is probably also responsible for the deletions.
               </li>
               <li>b. The play was cut first, the calls for the characters being added
                  afterwards. This is shown by the way in which the calls and entrances make
                  allowance for the cuts (see, for example, I.ii.5). A few cuts, however, were
                  made after the original calls.
               </li>
               <li>c. The calls for the characters wanted in a scene are essentially
                  non-anticipative. Exceptions may be seen, however, in the use of `Bee
                  ready', twice (IV.iii and V.i. 259), and something of an anticipative nature
                  may be found in the habit, where a new scene begins at the top of the next
                  page or even at the top of the second column, of placing the call for the
                  characters at the bottom of the preceding page or column. An extreme case of
                  this occurs in the notation for I.iii, where the entries for `Duke / Fryer
                  Tho.' are marked at the bottom of the first column, although Scene iii does
                  not begin immediately at the top of the second column. Except for the `Bee
                  ready' notations this is perhaps the clearest case of an anticipative call
                  in the prompt-book. At the beginning of IV.i, which falls at the top of a
                  new page (64), a `Song' is called for by the text. The prompter's call for
                  the song, however, is given on page 63 at the point where, with the cutting
                  of the Duke's final speech, the reviser 
                  has concluded the act. Such a warning for something at the beginning of an
                  act is unique in the prompt-book.
               </li>
               <li>d. No characters are called for at the beginning of an act, all act breaks
                  being very carefully marked. See note on III.ii.274.
               </li>
               <li>e. There is a tendency for the prompter to bring characters on a little
                  before the Folio's s.d.'s indicate (see I.ii.85, 114; III.ii.41; V.i.166).
                  This is a characteristic of professional prompt-books.

                     Although PB does not cancel the F scene iii break at 119, as do modern
                     texts since Rowe, it obviously runs the two scenes together by bringing
                     the Provost, etc. on 4 lines earlier. It also makes another change in
                     the entry of Lucio and the Gentlemen who (see below) are brought on
                     separately just before Lucio's first speech at 128 (this in spite of the
                     fact that Lucio and `Gent' were included in the prompter's call at 114).
                     D'Avenant, Tonson, Bell, and Inchbald enter Lucio as in PB, though
                     Tonson does not include `Gentlemen' at all (only Lucio enters).

                     the first `t' should be read as `j'; the last `t' might be almost
                     anything. `B ffor t' may be some kind of shortened form for `Beaufort'.
                     No John Beaufort appears to be linked in any way with Sir Edward Dering.
                     The name seems to have no immediate connection with the prompt-book as
                     such and may have been written in later. The hand is certainly not that
