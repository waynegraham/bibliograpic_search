            <h1>Introduction<br> Macbeth: Padua First Folio
            </h1>
            <p>In the section of the General Introduction devoted to the Padua prompt-books, I
               have attempted to link this prompt-book of <em>Macbeth</em>, as
               well as the other two Padua prompt-books, with Sir Edward Dering's group of
               amateur actors at Surrenden in Kent. At the same time I tried to show on grounds
               other than the coincidence of actors' names and initials that this version of
               <em>Macbeth</em> (and the other Padua prompt-books likewise)
               should probably be dated somewhere between 1625 and 1635.<a href="#n1" class="super">[1]</a> The evidence for this dating was not conclusive; on the other
               hand there was no conflicting evidence to challenge an early date. If we accept
               such a date, the Padua <em>Macbeth</em> and the other Padua
               prompt-books represent the only pre-Restoration Shakespearean prompt-books now
               extant.<a href="#n2" class="super">[2]</a>
               
            </p>
            <p>Also examined in the General Introduction was the vexing and finally insoluble
               question of the extent to which Dering's changes, cuts, etc., allowing that they
               may be associated with him or another member of his group, represent personal
               and unprofessional reactions to the text, or whether the treatment of the text
               arises from a knowledge (however gained) of what was being done on the
               professional stage in the first three decades of the century. 
            </p>
            <p>The version of <em>Macbeth</em> which here emerges from the
                reviser-prompter's grasp (only one hand can
               be distinguished)<a href="#n3" class="super">[3]</a> shows, if we compare it with the
               Smock Alley prompt-book, comparatively slight alterations.<a href="#n4" class="super">[4]</a> Some lines (actually fewer, since this figure includes a few
               half-lines) are cut. Of these 292 lines, 217 are accounted for by five
               substantial cuts: 
            </p>
            <p>II.iii.1-23 (the Porter scene). This cut would have pleased Coleridge, but it is
               clearly made on the assumption not that it is poor stuff (the Porter's
               conversation with Macduff remains untouched), but because it is an easy passage
               to delete without any obvious complication. The Smock Alley prompt-book retains
               only lines 1-5 and 24-27. In D'Avenant's version the Porter (played by a
               Servant) is cut to one line, a handling of the scene which survived even after
               Garrick 'restored' <em>Macbeth</em>. The Douai MS (1694) reduces
               the Porter scene to: 'Enter a Porter dressing himselfe. / Knock all the while. /
               P: here's a knocking indeed: who's there in the name of / belzebub? anon; anon;
               I am Coming. (Opens the doore.) / Enter Macduffe and Lenox / Macd: was [<em>sic</em>] so late friend, ere you went to bed / That you doe
               lye so long / P: faith sir we were carowsing till the second cock. / Macd: is
               thy master  stirring? / Enter Macbeth. / our
               knocking hath him here he comes.' Lee gives the Servant three short speeches
               (one from D'Avenant and two original efforts). The Collier MS cuts 5-23 ('Here's
               . . . Bonfire') , 27-47 ( And . . . him.). 
            </p>
            <p>III.i.71-140 (the first interview with the two Murtherers). The alteration in
               line 48 ('bid em stay there for me') allows the reviser to omit the whole
               interview between Macbeth and the Murtherers, lines 72-140 below. Since the
               reviser seems to have been interested in cutting Macbeth's role, this deletion
               was an obvious choice, the theatrics of the scene resembling the kind of thing
               Shakespeare was busy with in <em>Richard III</em>. D'Avenant cuts
               about 10 lines and rewrites slightly; Smock Alley cuts 7 lines; Douai MS, 13;
               Garrick, 26; and Lee, 22 (rephrasing a little). 
            </p>
            <p>III.vi (the scene of comment on Banquo's murder). This is clearly the sort of
               scene which a reviser on the watch for material to cut would single out. Though
               expository in nature, the scene contains nothing essential to the understanding
               of the remainder of the play. The Smock Alley prompt-book and the Garrick and
               Lee versions also omit this "flat, uninteresting scene" (Bell, p. 44). 
            </p>
            <p>IV.iii.2-31, 66-100, 149-158 (part of the Malcolm-Macduff interview). These lines
               are cut to shorten a long and "painfully tedious" scene (Bell, p. 52). The scene
               is even more drastically reduced in D'Avenant's text; the Douai MS cuts only 8
               lines, Garrick about 80, and Lee, eked out by bits of D'Avenant, about 116.
               D'Avenant, Smock Alley, Garrick, and Lee cut the whole 'Doctor episode'. Why the
               reviser here should decide to keep part of the episode I do not understand
               unless perhaps it furnished a few lines for an actor ('T S') whose other part
               (or parts) left him without anything to say. Apart from these major deletions
               the play (originally a short one of 2,084 lines) is very slightly reduced.<a href="#n5" class="super">[5]</a>
               
            </p>
            <p>Some of the cuts, changes, and prompt-notations deserve special comment. In
               general much of the cutting seems to be aimed at reducing the length of
               Macbeth's part; for this reason the deletion of the first interview with the
               Murtherers (III.i. 71-140) was an inevitable cut and is skillfully enough
               patched over by the reviser. At the opening of I.vii, the prompter calls only
               for Macbeth and takes no notice of the <em>'Ho boyes'</em>,
               
               
            </p>
            <p><em>'Torches'</em>, and <em>'Sewer'</em> for which the Folio calls
               (at I.vi a call for <em>'Hoboys'</em> noted by the prompter has been crossed
               through and he also ignores the Folio call for <em>'Hoboyes'</em>
               at IV.i. 106). Although the prompter tends to ignore <em>'Attendants'</em> in
               his calls (e.g., I.ii, I.vi, etc.), he is (except for <em>'Hoboys'</em>) more
               careful about notations for musical soundings, etc. It would seem, therefore,
               that it was intended to cut the 'show' of the banquet in progress and to
               introduce <em>Macbeth</em> directly. The same change is made in the D'Avenant,
               Smock Alley, and Garrick versions. Again, stage business seems to be slightly
               changed at the beginning of III.iv, where the reviser cuts line 10, a line which
               can be taken to mean that Macbeth seats himself with his guests before joining
               the First Murtherer (here altered to '2 Murtherer'). The deletion of line 10
               implies that Macbeth, after welcoming his guests, turns aside directly to talk
               with the '2 Murtherer'. D'Avenant and Lee likewise cut. We may also notice that
               the physical appearance of the Ghost of Banquo in this scene is twice vouched
               for by marginal prompt calls. Some evidence of a desire by the reviser to cut
               down on the number of 'extras' may be seen in the substitution at III.i and
               III.iv of 'Angus' in place of the Folio <em>'Lords'</em>, and of
               'Angus Rosse, Y Seyward' at V.vi in place of the Folio <em>'their Army'</em>. In
               V.viii, however, <em>'Thanes'</em> is expanded to 'Angus Cathnes Mentith Lenox'.
               We may also note that in III.i the reviser brings Macbeth's Servant on at line
               44, a handling of the scene found likewise in the Smock Alley version. Later
               edited texts consider the Servant as being among the <em>'Attendants'</em> at
               the opening of the scene. Some of the cuts are clearly made to get rid of
               difficult passages or passages considered merely poetic. For the first, note the
               deletions at I.vii.50-54; II.iii.55; III.ii.15; for the second, see I.vii.5-12;
               V.iii.20-29. The cut at IV.iii.120-121 deletes a reference to the deity and the
               deletion of the lines on the 'poore player' (V.v.24-26) may reflect a histrionic
               touchiness.<a href="#n6" class="super">[6]</a>
               
               
            </p>
            <p>Little has been added in the way of props or offstage sounds. At III.iii.8 there
               is a call for 'Treacle' to indicate the approach of Banquo's and Fleance's
               horses;<a href="#n7" class="super">7</a> and at IV.i a 'Cauldorne' is called for.
               'Thunder' is duly called for, as in the Folio, by the prompter at the beginning
               of III.v, but not at the opening of IV.i, perhaps because this is the beginning
               of an act. For some reason it was decided to dispense with the Folio call for
               <em>'Musicke'</em> at III.v.31-33 and IV.i.42-43; only 'Song'
               is called for in both instances, though a call for 'musiq<em>ue</em>'
               has been crossed through at III.v.33, and Folio <em>'Musicke'</em> is
               again ignored in the call for the Witches' dance at IV.i.132. We may also notice
               the prompter's addition of 'Senett' at the opening of III.iv.<a href="#n8" class="super">8</a>
               
            </p>
            <p>Several of the minor roles have been assigned by the prompter to individuals by
               name or initials. 'M<em>r</em> Carlile' (or 'M<em>r</em>
               Carl') doubled as one of the 'Murtherers' at the end of IV.ii and as a
               'Messenger' at V.v.27-29. A 'M<em>r</em> H &lt;.&gt; w &lt;. .&gt;',
               'H.wit', or 'H&lt;ewi&gt;t' (the name is far from clear)<a href="#n9" class="super">9</a> played a messenger at IV.ii.64. He is perhaps the same person as
               the 'E H' who plays a 'Seruant' at I.v.31, III.i.43-44, III.ii (opening), and
               V.iii.8-9. The Doctor at IV.iii.139 is played by 'T S' and the Doctor in V.iii
               by 'M<em>r</em> G'. A 'M<em>r</em> K' plays the '2
               Murtherer' in III.iv.7-8. It is on the basis of these names ('T S' appears again
               as a 'Servant' and a 'Lord' in <em>Winter's Tale</em>) that I have suggested an
               association with Sir Edward Dering's group of amateurs.<a href="#n10" class="super">10</a>
               
            </p>
            <p>The following characteristics of the prompt-book are worth pointing out:<a href="#n11" class="super">[11]</a>
               
               
            </p>
            <p>a. A single hand seems to be responsible for all the markings, whether
               prompt-calls or revisions affecting the text. 
            </p>
            <p>b. The prompt-calls and calls for sound effects are not anticipative (except
               occasionally by a line or two). 
            </p>
            <p>c. There are no calls for characters entering at the beginning of an act. </p>
            <p>d. Act breaks are carefully marked; see especially the end of Act III. </p>
            <p>e. The calls for characters in a new scene are sometimes given at the end of the
               preceding scene (e.g., I.iii, II.iii, IV.ii, V.iii) instead of at the beginning
               of the new scene. This may imply the lack of much real sense of break between
               scenes. Compare Sir E. K. Chambers' comments in his <em>William Shakespeare</em>
               (1 930), I, 118. 
            </p>
            <p>f. Entrances and sound effects are frequently marked with a short horizontal line
               following or preceding the line of the play before entry or effect. 
            </p>
            <p>g. The prompter ignores regularly the Folio call for <em>'Attendants'</em> (e.g., I.ii, I.vi) and <em>'Soldiers'</em>
               (e.g., V.ii, V.iv). 
            </p>
            <p>h. Note the general expansion of the Folio stage directions in the final scenes
               of Act V. 
            </p>
            <p>i. In I.vii, at Lady <em>Macbeth</em>'s entrance (l. 25), we can see that the
               cutting was done before the prompt-call was written in; otherwise the call for
               Lady <em>Macbeth</em> would have followed line 28 as in Folio. The order here
               implied is the natural order, but it is sometimes difficult to establish.

                  <p> 2. The First Folio text of <em>Macbeth</em>, of course, shows
                     signs of being printed from copy-text having connection with the theatre. A
                     prompt-book of <em>Twelfth Night</em>, of unknown provenience (see General
                     Introduction, p. 4), has been described as pre-Restoration (see
                     Halliwell-Phillipps, <em>Some Account of the Antiquities, Coins, Manuscripts
                        . . . Illustrative of the Life and Works of Shakespeare</em>, Brighton
                     Hill [1852], p. 115). The evidence for a pre-Restoration date
                     (Halliwell-Phillipps dates it about 1640) is quite inconclusive.

                     Sir Edward seems to have written two fairly distinct hands and may have used
                     others. The same hand has inserted 'Troylus and Cressida' at the beginning

                  <p> 4. A detailed comparison has been made with D'Avenant's 1674
                     version (and with the Yale MS of D'Avenant's version), the Smock Alley
                     version (<em>c.</em> 1680), the Douai MS version (1694), and
                     the much later versions of Garrick (1744) and Lee (1753). Agreements in
                     cutting with the Collier-Perkins Second Folio have also been noted. The
                     D'Avenant text used is that in <em>Dramatic Works</em>, ed. Maidment and
                     Logan, V (1874), 297-394; the Yale MS adds nothing to the printed text so
                     far as this study is concerned. The Douai MS (in the Douai Public Library,
                     MS 7.87, fols. 171-209), entitled 'The Tragedye of Macbeth' and dated 'Anno
                     Dñi 1694', is based on the Second Folio text, but gives evidence of
                     influence from the First Folio (or possibly the 1673 quarto). It shows no
                     immediate connection with the theatre, but contains numerous verbal
                     'improvements' and makes a good many cuts. The MS, of which I intend to make
                     a separate study, is here used for the first time. The Garrick cutting was
                     printed in Bell's <em>Shakespeare</em> (1773), I. Its connections with
                     Garrick are established by G. W. Stone, Jr. ("Garrick's Handling of
                     <em>Macbeth</em>," <em>SP</em> [1941], XXXVIII, 609-628).
                     Stone also gives some details of other later eighteenth-century versions.
                     John Lee's adaptation was published in Edinburgh in 1753 as <em>The
                        Historical Tragedy of Macbeth</em> (Hogan, <em>Shakespeare in the
                        Theatre</em>, II [1957], 361, lists only a Dublin edition of 1761 and
                     says that Lee's alteration was first acted at Edinburgh 1 January 1754). It
                     is still strongly tinctured with D'Avenant, but a good deal of the original
                     has been restored. This acting version is not mentioned by G. C. D. Odell
                     (<em>Shakespeare from Betterton to Irving</em> [1920], 2 vols.), Stone
                     (op. cit.), or A. C. Sprague (<em>Shakespeare and the Actors</em> [1948]),
                     though it contains a number of interesting theatre characteristics.

                     Alley version and the 310 lines which Garrick cut in the course of his
                     "restoration" of the original in 1744. The Lee version is too confused with
                     D' Avenant to make a comparison useful. The number of lines in <em>Macbeth</em> is based on Alfred Hart's count (<em>RES</em> [1932], VIII, 21). I count roughly 2,124 lines
                     in D'Avenant's version, 1,732 in Smock Alley, 1,846 in Garrick's, and 1,857
                     in Lee's (these figures are somewhat lower than those given by Stone [p.
                     621] for Shakespeare, D'Avenant, and Garrick).

                     actor-manager of sorts) makes the same cut on the plea that he considers the
                     lines "as a play-house interpolation, and what Shakespeare would never have
                     put into the mouth of a just man labouring under violent perturbation"
                     (Macbeth, ed. Harry Rowe, 2nd ed. [York, 1799], p. 105). Lee softens to 'a
                     mere player'.

                     217. Mr. Lawrence notes this scene (together with IV.i) as the earliest
                     example in English drama calling for this particular sound effect, and draws
                     attention to the lack of any "elucidative stage direction" in the Folio. His
                     inference that such a sound effect was intended here is nicely supported by
                     the Padua prompt-book.

                     69, is difficult to explain. In the second instance, perhaps, the
                     suggestion of 'fatalism' frightened the reviser as it
                      later frightened Francis Gentleman
                     (Bell, p. 34), who remarks: "We would not wish young, unsettled minds to
                     peruse or hear this piece, without proper companions, to prevent absurd
                     prejudices." He did not, however, advocate cutting the lines.

                     D'Avenant and Lee omit initial call for <em>'Thunder'</em> (though it appears in the Yale MS of D'Avenant's
