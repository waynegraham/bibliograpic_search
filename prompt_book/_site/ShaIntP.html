            <h1>Preface</h1>
            <p>THE Padua <em>Macbeth</em> prompt-book forms the first volume in a
               series of seventeenth-century Shakespearean prompt-books to be published under
               the auspices of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia. The
               prompt-book is reproduced in collotype facsimile (reduced in size by 10 per
               cent), accompanied by a critical Introduction and a complete collation and
               description of all cuts, changes, prompt-calls, property notes, etc. and a
               detailed comparison of these with later seventeenth- and eighteenth-century
               acting versions. A General Introduction to the whole series prefaces this first
               volume. 
            </p>
            <p> Other plays to be issued in the same format will include the Padua <em>Measure for Measure</em>, the 'Nursery' <em>Comedy of Errors</em>, and the Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em>,
               <em>Macbeth</em>, <em>Lear</em>, <em>Othello</em>, <em>Henry VIII</em>, <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, and <em>Merry
                  Wives of Windsor</em>. The remaining plays (see the General Introduction,
               pp. 4-5) will, with two exceptions, be presented in a final volume, but without
               facsimiles of the complete prompt-books. The exceptions, the Padua <em>Winter's Tale</em> and the 'Nursery' <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, will be included in earlier volumes in order
               to complete the Dering and 'Nursery' groups. 
            </p>
            <p> The following libraries have most kindly granted me permission to publish
               special materials from their collections: the Folger Shakespeare Library,
               Washington, D.C.; the Library of the University of Edinburgh, Scotland; the
               Huntington Library, San Marino, California; and the Yale University Library, New
               Haven, Connecticut. Further individual acknowledgement will be made as the
               materials appear in the series. 
            </p>
            <p>Many people have been helpful and unselfish in the preparation of this work, but
               my gratitude is especially owing to Professor
                Giordano Orsini for allowing me to trespass
               on his pioneer work with the Padua First Folio prompt-books; to Dr. L. W. Sharp
               for his kindness in waiving his first rights in the 'Nursery' and Smock Alley
               prompt-books belonging to the University of Edinburgh Library; to my friends and
               colleagues Professor T. W. Baldwin, Dr. Giles Dawson, Professor Harris Fletcher,
               Professor Sears Jayne, Dr. J. G. McManaway, Professor R. W. Rogers, Professor
               Arthur Sherbo, Dr. Allan Stevenson, Professor Jack Stillinger, and Professor
               William Van Lennep, each of whom expended precious time in advice and criticism;
               to Dr. Arthur Pennell who for four years served indefatigably as my research
               assistant; and to Professor Fredson Bowers to whom I owe much both in form and
               substance and through whose sympathetic interest these volumes have been brought
               to press. It is with the deepest regret that I cannot once again, as always
               before, thank my old teacher and friend, the late Professor Hyder E. Rollins. 
            </p>
            <p> I should also like to thank Miss Eva Faye Benton, Miss Alma DeJordy, and Miss
               Isabelle F. Grant, all of the University of Illinois Library, and Mr. C. P.
               Finlayson of the University of Edinburgh Library. Particular thanks are also due
               to the Research Board of the University of Illinois for continually generous
               financial assistance and to the Board of Trustees for sabbatical leave granted
               to me in 1956 to pursue my studies in England. Finally, I owe a special debt to
               the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia for undertaking the
               publication of my work in this form.

            <h1>General Introduction</h1>
            <p>I am concerned in the present study with a comparatively small collection of
               special Shakespeare materials: printed texts of Shakespeare's plays which give
               evidence of a seventeenth-century theatrical provenience and thus record for us
               some of the acting innovations, readings, and traditions current on the stage
               during that period. In general, such texts may be described as prompt-books,
               though I have included several acting versions which strictly do not fall into
               this category. 
            </p>
            <p>The complete study will afford a large body of detailed evidence about the text
               of Shakespeare's plays as they were presented on the stage during the last
               three-quarters of the seventeenth century. Since the time of Capell and Jennens
               in the second half of the eighteenth century the textual guesses, sometimes
               inspired and sometimes not, of a whole army of learned editors have been
               reverently and meticulously recorded, an accumulation which resulted finally in
               the Cambridge Shakespeare and the New Variorum of Furness and his successors.
               Curiously, however, although there are numerous excellent general studies of
               seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Shakespearean acting versions, both
               published and manuscript, there is little detailed study or record of the actual
               texts as such. For eighteenth-century printed theatre versions C. B. Hogan's
               recent and invaluable <em>Shakespeare in the Theatre,
                  1701-1800</em> (1952-57) must be noticed as an exception, though even Mr.
               Hogan does not pretend to be complete in his lists of cuts and (particularly)
               textual changes. This study, therefore, is an attempt, using special and
               generally unavailable materials, partially to fill this gap in our knowledge of
               Shakespeare in the theatre for the seventeenth century. It should be emphasized,
                perhaps, that seventeenth-century printed
               texts such as the 1681 <em>Othello</em> or the 1676 <em>Hamlet</em>, which represent published acting texts, are
               included only so far as they serve to illustrate the theatre prompt-book under
               discussion. Since in this study I have aimed at a measure of completeness, every
               effort has been made to establish the relationship between the
               seventeenth-century and the principal eighteenth-century acting versions. In
               order to do this it has been necessary to compare in detail each cut, textual
               change, setting, etc. with its several seventeenth- and eighteenth-century
               counterparts and to record the results in the notes to the collations and, more
               generally, in the separate introductions to each play. Only in this way can the
               uniqueness or community of a cut or reading in the seventeenth- and
               eighteenth-century versions be recognized and a picture of the oral stage
               tradition (for the text especially) begin to emerge. Nineteenth-century acting
               versions, except for an occasional use of Mrs. Inchbald's <em>British Theatre</em> (1808), I have considered outside the scope of the
               present study. 
            </p>
            <p>The materials may be divided into four groups. (I) Three pre-Restoration
               prompt-books (<em>Macbeth</em>, <em>Measure for
                  Measure</em>, <em>Winter's Tale</em>) which belong together,
               being found in a copy of the First Folio now in the University Library at Padua,
               and may be linked, as I shall try to show, with Sir Edward Dering of Surrenden
               in Kent (<em>c.</em> 1625-35). (II) Two prompt-books (<em>Comedy of Errors</em>, <em>Midsummer Night's
                  Dream</em>), both from a copy of the First Folio, connected with the Hatton
               Garden Nursery (<em>c.</em> 1672). (III) Eleven prompt-books (<em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Macbeth</em>, <em>Othello</em>, <em>King Lear</em>, <em>Twelfth Night</em>, <em>Midsummer Night's
                  Dream</em>, <em>Henry VIII</em>, <em>I Henry
                  IV</em>, <em>Comedy of Errors</em>, <em>Merry
                  Wives</em>, and <em>Winter's Tale</em>), all from a copy of
               the Third Folio, belonging to the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin (<em>c.</em> 1676-85). (IV) A prompt-book of <em>Twelfth Night</em> (Second Folio) which, though it is of unknown
               provenience, is almost certainly seventeenth-century; an incomplete cutting of
               <em>Merchant of Venice</em>, Second Folio, which, though also
               of uncertain provenience, is probably seventeenth-century in origin; and three
               texts (<em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, 1599 quarto; <em>Merry Wives</em>, 1633 quarto; 
            </p>

            <p>
               <em>Much Ado</em>, 1600 quarto), of which the theatrical
               provenience is doubtful. Finally, as an appendix, I have included a complete
               list of the deletions marked in the notorious Collier-Perkins Second Folio. 
            </p>
            <p><em>Group I: Pre-Restoration prompt-books.</em> The Padua
               prompt-books, part of a First Folio in the University Library at Padua, have
               been 'discovered' several times. Attention was first called to them by an
               'Occasional Correspondent' in the <em>Scotsman</em> (11 July
               1895). Sir Sidney Lee then listed the Padua Folio in the Supplement to his
               facsimile of the First Folio (Oxford, 1902) and described it as having "early
               MS. notes, made apparently by an acting manager." It was not until 1932,
               however, that anyone seems to have paid further attention; in that year G. N.
               Giordano Orsini published an account of them as part of an article entitled
               "Nuovi orientamenti della Filologia shakespeariana" in <em>Civiltà moderna</em> (1932, IV, 3-46), an account which contained,
               as an appendix, a nearly complete list of the textual deletions in the three
               prompt-books. Giordano Orsini's study seems to have passed almost unnoticed in
               this country.<a href="#ShaGI1" class="super">[1]</a> In 1936, Leslie F. Casson,
               apparently independently of Giordano Orsini's article, offered a general
               discussion of all three prompt-books, noting the principal changes (and some of
               the deletions), and made an attempt to date them by trying to associate the
               actors' names and initials with particular actors in the Restoration.<a href="#ShaGI2" class="super">[2]</a> That Casson was mistaken in his identifications
               will I think appear from the discussion below. Like Giordano Orsini's, Casson's
               article passed unnoticed, except for a listing in <em>Studies in
                  Philology</em>. Finally, in 1950, I 'discovered' the Padua prompt-books all
               over again and was subsequently considerably chagrined to find that I had been
               anticipated not once, but three times! 
            </p>
            <p>It is not known how or when this copy of the First Folio
                came into the hands of the University
               Library at Padua. The volume was accidentally discovered about 1895 "amongst a
               number of uncatalogued books".<a href="#ShaGI3" class="super">[3]</a> My letter of
               enquiry has received no response, and Casson, though on the spot, was unable to
               uncover any further information. The book is bound in brown leather, almost
               certainly its original English binding.<a href="#ShaGI4" class="super">[4]</a> A label
               which reads 'Tutte le Opere di: / Sakespear / Commedie e Tragedie. / manca il
               Frontispizio' has been pasted on the inside of the front board (the front and
               back end-papers, sig. A1, and the engraved title-page are lacking). The
               handwriting is eighteenth-century, or possibly seventeenth, and suggests that
               the volume arrived in Italy fairly early in its career. Below the label, in the
               same hand, is written 'F in capsa / ad Læuam' (i.e., ?Folio in the
               left-hand chest or drawer).<a href="#ShaGI5" class="super">[5]</a> The number '385'
               appears in the upper left corner. On sig. 3b6<em>v</em> another hand
               has written a phrase of which I can make no sense whatever: 'in /
               &lt;Som.are&gt; content<em>um</em>.'. The letters recorded for
               the second word are very uncertain: 'S' might well be read as 'T', 'm' as 'ui'
               or 'ni', etc.; and the form 'content<em>um</em>' should perhaps
               be read 'contentionem'. Below, on the same page, another hand has added what may
               be a date 'M'y 6'. The inner back board contains what may possibly be either a
               library number or acquisition date (?1695), perhaps both (see the reproduction
               opposite page 4), and a scrawl in English, in yet another hand, beginning 'and
               one y &lt;.n.&gt; &amp; &lt;ta.n.&gt; &lt;etc&gt;' (all but the first two words
               badly smudged). Finally, we may notice what appears, when disentangled, to be
               the name 'joh: B ffort' scribbled down the left margin of sig. F6<em>v</em> in the prompt-book of <em>Measure for Measure</em>. I
               cannot associate the hand with that in the prompt-book or with any other in the
               volume. 
               
            </p>
            <p>The full importance of the Padua prompt-books has not hitherto been recognized;
               they are, I believe, our earliest examples of Shakespearean prompt-books and
               should be dated about 1625-35. The evidence for such dating must now be
               considered in full. 
            </p>
            <p>The Padua prompt-books contain no indication of location or scene setting.
               Restoration prompt-books, except in unusual circumstances, regularly indicate
               the set to be used with each change of scene.<a href="#ShaGI6" class="super">[6]</a> In
               <em>Macbeth</em> and <em>Measure for
                  Measure</em> the prompter's calls are not anticipatory (except in one or two
               cases). This fact at once distinguishes these two Padua promptbooks from
               Restoration prompt-books and in itself suggests a date in the later 1620's, for,
               as W. J. Lawrence observes, " . . . so far as the prompter was concerned, the
               system of advance calls for players, musicians, and properties first came into
               vogue somewhere in the period 1625-31."<a href="#ShaGI7" class="super">[7]</a>
               
            </p>
            <p>Other points also serve to support an early date. A 'Senett' is called for at the
               opening of IV.iv in <em>Macbeth</em>, where the Folio stage
               direction makes no such provision. By 1660 the technical theatre term 'sennet'
               seems to have been completely obsolete; indeed the <em>NED</em>
               records no later use than 1619. The  calls
               'Bee ready Group II:' (<em>Measure for Measure</em>, IV.iii) and
               'Bee ready' (V.i.259) are definitely on a pre-Restoration formula found
               occasionally in prompt-books belonging to the second and third decades of the
               century.<a href="#ShaGI8" class="super">[8]</a> I have seen no cases of this
               particular imperative warning in Restoration promptbooks. Again, the complete
               absence of any attempt to 'modernize' Shakespeare's language immediately
               distinguishes the Padua prompt-books from most Restoration acting versions,
               particularly among the tragedies. There is also the evidence of the handwriting.
               Two quite distinct hands are et work: Hand I, that in <em>Macbeth</em> and <em>Measure for Measure</em>;<a href="#ShaGI9" class="super">[9]</a> and Hand II, that in <em>The
                  Winter's Tale</em>. Both hands give the impression of early rather than late
               seventeenth-century formation, though this is a matter on which it is possible
               to be badly misled. 
            </p>
            <p>Finally, there is the important matter of provenience. Like a number of others,
               the Padua prompt-books contain the names or initials of certain minor actors
               among the prompt-calls, and it is possible, I believe, to identify three of
               these individuals with persons who took part in an amateur performance of
               Fletcher's <em>Spanish Curate</em> produced by Sir Edward Dering
               at his estate, Surrenden, in Kent, between 22 October 1622 (the date on which
               the play was licensed) and "the summer of 1624".<a href="#ShaGI10" class="super">[10]</a> Among the names listed by Sir Edward for <em>The
                  Spanish Curate</em> are 'Jhon Carlile', 'Tho: Slender', and 'Mr. Kemp'.
               <a href="#ShaGI11" class="super">[11]</a> In the Padua <em>Macbeth</em> we find 'M<em>r</em> Carlile' (and 'M<em>r</em> Carl'),  'T S', and 'M<em>r</em> K'. The other three names which appear in <em>Macbeth</em> are 'M<em>r</em> G', 'E H', and 'M<em>r</em> H&lt;e&gt;w&lt;it&gt;', none of which occurs in <em>The Spanish Curate list.</em> Trying to link these with Sir
               Edward Dering is perhaps hazardous. I would, however, suggest that 'M<em>r</em> G' may be a certain 'Georg Perd' who figures in <em>The Spanish Curate</em> list and who knew Sir Edward well
               enough to subscribe a letter with 'Thus in hast with my service to you<em>r</em> dearr self and &lt;vert&gt;uous Lady in some hast I end
               You<em>r</em> most affectionate friend Geo: Pearde.'<a href="#ShaGI12" class="super">[12]</a> The only 'E H' I can associate with Sir Edward
               is the well-known Sir Edward Hales and that he should appear as a mere 'E H'
               seems highly unlikely. The third name, which should prove most helpful, is
               unfortunately very questionable. Giordano Orsini reads 'H.wit'<a href="#ShaGI13" class="super">[13]</a> and Casson 'H&lt;ewi&gt;t', remarking, "This
               name is difficult to decipher, but is possibly 'Mr. H&lt;ewi&gt;t'".<a href="#ShaGI14" class="super">[14]</a> I am fairly sure of two letters: 'H&lt;.&gt;w&lt;.
               .&gt;'. There are two possible candidates. One is a certain 'Geo: Haule' or 'Cosen
               Hawle' as Dering calls him.<a href="#ShaGI15" class="super">[15]</a> The other is an
               individual called 'Hugett', an acceptable spelling of 'Hewit'', who figures in a
               long list of names at the end of Sir Edward's 'pocket-book' for the year
               1637.<a href="#ShaGI16" class="super">[16]</a>
               
            </p>
            <p>That Sir Edward Dering was interested in the theatre and in Shakespeare is
               apparent from the telescoped version of <em>I</em> and <em>II Henry IV</em> which is now generally known as the Dering
               MS. This manuscript, the first page of which is in Dering's hand,<a href="#ShaGI17" class="super">[17]</a> contains numerous corrections and additions by
               him.  We also hear, in 1619, of nine
               shillings spent for 'twenty-seven play-bookes'<a href="#ShaGI18" class="super">[18]</a>
               and, in 1637, eighteen years later, Dering was still buying more 'playbookes'.
               In his pocket-book for that year a list of 'Bookes in print' begins with 'Duche
               armes in print / Epitaphes. epithalamy's. playbookes / witchery.' and ends with
               'Lat. Bible. Septuagint / Tertullian / Shakespeare / &lt;....&gt; &lt;....&gt;
               painted / virgel and other poets of y<em>e</em> best / qu: de omni
               modis biblijs / Lat Graec Anglic.'.<a href="#ShaGI19" class="super">[19]</a> The exact
               purpose of this list (mostly crossed through) is not clear, though it most
               probably represents a collection of books sent to be bound and not necessarily
               recent purchases. Dates of individual volumes range from 1573 to 1632, and the
               'Shakespeare' so temptingly exhibited could be either a First or Second Folio. 
            </p>
            <p>In setting out the evidence for the Dering provenience I have tried to avoid
               pressing the claim too strongly. The case hangs essentially on one name and two
               initials and cannot be considered conclusive. Nevertheless, it may, I think, be
               admitted as at least persuasive, especially as the Dering provenience squares
               perfectly with the other evidences of date already discussed. One point,
               however, must now be noticed which may be considered to argue against attaching
               the Padua prompt-books to the amateur Dering group. This is their apparently
               professional appearance. In format they give the impression of having been
               prepared by persons thoroughly familiar with the conventions of prompt-book
               makers during the later 1620's and 1630's. It might be argued that Dering had
               procured professional assistance in preparing these copies from
                the official prompt-book, but this approach
               seems to be ruled out by the fact that where an actor is named as playing one of
               the minor roles, the hand is the same in both call and actor's name. Moreover
               The Winter's Tale, which is cut only up to I.iii, assigns two small roles to 'T
               S', showing that here at least the roles were assigned as the calls were written
               in. Various solutions might be advanced, but none could be more than the merest
               hypothesis. 
            </p>
            <p>But even if we cannot argue very warmly for professional help with the actual
               preparation of the prompt-books, the question remains of how far Dering's
               changes, if we accept them as either his or changes made by one of his
               associates, may be taken to reflect contemporary theatre practice. Considering
               Dering's known interest in the drama, it seems fair to assume that in some part
               at least the alterations may be taken to represent what Dering had seen on the
               professional stage during his visits to London, and it is interesting to notice
               how often the changes in <em>Macbeth</em> are reflected in the
               Restoration D'Avenant and Smock Alley versions. Such continuity suggests a
               professional source, however come by, for some of the changes in the Padua <em>Macbeth</em>, and, by association, in the Padua <em>Measure for Measure</em> and <em>The Winter's
                  Tale</em>. This last argument will hold, of course, even if we refuse to
               accept the Dering provenience. 
            </p>
            <p>Detailed discussion of the individual prompt-books will be given in the separate
               introduction to each play. 
            </p>
            <p><em>Group II: Restoration 'Nursery' prompt-books.</em> These
               prompt-books of <em>The Comedy of Errors</em> and <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, now preserved in the University
               of Edinburgh Library, the gift of Halliwell-Phillipps, are our only extant
               examples of seventeenth-century ?London prompt-books of Shakespeare's plays.
               Only <em>The Comedy of Errors</em> reached production; <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em> merely shows evidence of cutting
               (no prompt-calls, etc.). Both are part of a First Folio, and the cutting in both
               seems to be the work of the same hand. On the basis of the cast for <em>The Comedy of Errors</em>, which it is
                possible to reconstruct completely from the
               prompter's calls, we may with some assurance date these prompt-books <em>c.</em> 1672. A full discussion of the provenience, cast, and
               dating may be reserved for the separate introduction to <em>The
                  Comedy of Errors</em>. 
            </p>
            <p><em>Group III: The Smock Alley prompt-books.</em> The eleven
               prompt-books in this group (<em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Macbeth</em>, <em>Othello</em>, <em>King
                  Lear</em>, <em>Twelfth Night</em>, <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, <em>Henry VIII</em>, <em>I Henry IV</em>, <em>Comedy of Errors</em>,
               <em>Merry Wives</em>, <em>Winter's Tale</em>)
               have been known since the middle of the nineteenth century and were once in the
               possession of Halliwell-Phillipps.<a href="#ShaGI20" class="super">[20]</a> All but two
               now form part of the Folger Shakespeare Library collection of prompt-books.<a href="#ShaGI21" class="super">[21]</a> The remaining two (<em>Hamlet</em> and <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em>) are
               preserved in the University of Edinburgh Library. 
            </p>
            <p>Originally there appear to have been similar promptbooks of <em>Julius Caesar</em> and <em>II Henry IV</em>, possibly also
               of <em>Measure for Measure</em>, <em><em>The Tempest</em></em>, and <em>Troilus and
                  Cressida</em>.<a href="#ShaGI22" class="super">[22]</a> The copies of <em>Troilus and Cressida</em> and <em>Julius
                  Caesar</em> were presented by Halliwell-Phillipps to the Shakespeare
               Memorial Library at Birmingham and were there unfortunately destroyed in the
               fire of 1879.<a href="#ShaGI23" class="super">[23]</a> For <em>Julius
                  Caesar</em>, however. a cast  (written
               on the last page of <em>Timon of Athens</em>) has survived, as
               well as a manuscript couplet scrawled down the right margin of the first page of
               <em>Macbeth</em> (facing the final page of <em>Julius Caesar</em>). The cast, which can be dated as not later than 1676,
               gives us important information on the personnel of the Smock Alley Theatre.<a href="#ShaGI24" class="super">[24]</a> The cast is as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>&lt;Jull&gt;ius Cesszer the Acto&lt;rs&gt; naims</li>

               <li>Caska M<em>r</em> Baker <a href="#ShaGI26" class="super">[26]</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Only two of these actors occur with certainty among the prompter's annotations in
               the other Shakespearean plays: Walmesley in <em>Othello</em>
               (I.iii) and Smith in <em>Henry VIII</em> (IV.ii) and <em>Macbeth</em> (V.iii).<a href="#ShaGI27" class="super">[27]</a> It is
               possible, however, that Williams appears 
               pears as '&lt;W&gt;illian' in <em>Hamlet</em> (V.ii) in the role
               of Laertes.<a href="#ShaGI28" class="super">[28]</a> Other actors whose names appear in
               the Shakespeare promptbooks are: Andrews (<em>Henry VIII</em>,
               I.i), Barnes (<em>Othello</em>, I.iii), Charles [?Ashbury] (<em>Othello</em>, I.iii; II.i), Farlow (<em>Macbeth</em>, III.i), Freeman (<em>Othello</em>, II.i),
               (Mistress) Kaine (<em>Henry VIII</em>, V.i), Longmore (<em>I Henry IV</em>, II.i), Totterdale (<em>Henry
                  VIII</em>, IV.i; <em>Macbeth</em>, V.v.; <em>Othello</em>, I.ii), and Trefusis (<em>Hamlet</em>, IV.v,
               vii; <em>Othello</em>, I.ii; II.i). What may be illegible or
               mutilated actors' names occur in <em>Othello</em> (I.ii.63), <em>Henry VIII</em> (I.i.161), and <em>Hamlet</em>
               (IV.v.113; V.ii.153).<a href="#ShaGI29" class="super">[29]</a> Barnes and Freeman also
               appear in the Smock Alley manuscript prompt-book of Wilson's <em>Belphegor</em> (<em>c.</em> 1677 or 1682) and Totterdale in
               the Smock Alley cast for Fletcher's <em>Night-Walker</em>
               (between 1670 and 1676). 
            </p>
            <p>The couplet from a Smock Alley production of <em>Julius
                  Caesar</em> which appears in the left margin of the first page of <em>Macbeth</em> reads: poore slavish rome far well: Ceaser
               now be still<br> I Kild not thee w<em>th</em> half so good a
               will<br> Dyes R. C. Bald notes that this couplet first appears, spoken
               by Brutus, in the so-called D'Avenant-Dryden version of the play published in
               1719 and that it seems likely that "the London alterations were known in the
               Dublin theatre some years at least before they were available in print."<a href="#ShaGI30" class="super">[30]</a> This would seem to suggest that Bald does not
               consider the possibility that the acting 
               list, which may be dated before 1677, and the hand that is responsible for the
               couplet are contemporary (admittedly they are not the same). Though there is
               nothing to prove that these two hands are contemporary, there is certainly
               nothing to prove that they are not. Bald's caution is dictated, I suppose, by
               Hazelton Spencer's rather categorical statement that the "limits <em>of composition</em> of this version [the D'Avenant-Dryden]
               are thus 1691 and 1719."<a href="#ShaGI31" class="super">[31]</a> But the arguments by
               which Spencer reaches this conclusion do not seem to me entirely satisfactory,
               and the appearance of this couplet possibly in connection with a production of
               the play in the middle 1670's (before the appearance of the 1684 Betterton
               quarto) at least opens up once again the whole question of D'Avenant's and
               Dryden's possible implication in producing the 'improvement'.<a href="#ShaGI32" class="super">[32]</a>
               
            </p>
            <p>Our knowledge of the one-time existence of a Smock Alley prompt-book of <em>II Henry IV</em> we owe to S. W. Singer. In his attack on
               Collier, <em>The Text of Shakespeare Vindicated</em> (1853),
               Singer describes (pp. vi-vii) a "tattered copy of the third folio edition of
               Shakespeare" which "chance has furnished" him ('chance' here being presumably
               Halliwell-Phillipps). He then gives a list of twelve plays with which he says
               "the greatest liberties have been taken" in revising them for the stage. This
               list includes, besides the lost <em>Julius Caesar</em> and ten
               plays now preserved in the Folger and at Edinburgh, <em>II Henry
                  IV</em>.<a href="#ShaGI33" class="super">[33]</a>
               
            </p>
            <p>Finally, the possibility that there were also Smock Alley
                prompt-books of <em>Measure
                  for Measure</em>, <em>Troilus and Cressida</em>, and <em>The Tempest</em> was first brought to light by J. G.
               McManaway.<a href="#ShaGI34" class="super">[34]</a> He was able to trace
               Halliwell-Phillipps' 'tattered copy' back to the library of John Dent. It was
               sold at the sale of Dent's books in 1827. The auction catalogue carefully
               describes the volume and offers four examples of the kind of manuscript
               corrections it contained: one each from <em>Troilus and
                  Cressida</em> and <em>Measure for Measure</em> and two from
               <em>The Tempest</em>. Unfortunately the cataloguer was
               interested only in textual emendations later suggested by either Rowe or Hanmer.
               McManaway considers these readings as anticipations of Rowe and Hanmer and does
               not believe it necessary to "postulate the intrusion of an otherwise unknown
               literary hand" in these three plays in view of the fact that "the various hands
               (Bald counts six in <em>Othello</em>) in the Folger copies of the
               plays appear to be connected with performances". But this is an
               oversimplification of the state of some of the extant Smock Alley promptbooks.
               In <em>King Lear</em>, <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Twelfth Night</em>, <em>Midsummer Night's
                  Dream</em>, and <em>Merry Wives</em> it is certain that some
               hand (described below as Hand H) about the middle of the eighteenth century
               busied itself (with what purpose is not clear) with incorporating the readings
               of various editors through at least Hanmer.<a href="#ShaGI35" class="super">[35]</a> It
               is also, I think, significant that Singer, who saw the volume before it was
               broken up by Halliwell-Phillipps, did not include <em>Measure for
                  Measure</em>, <em>Troilus and Cressida</em>, or <em>The Tempest</em> among those plays "with which the greatest
               liberties have been taken". In view of these considerations we must, I believe,
               accept the one-time existence of actual theatre prompt-books of these plays with
               some caution.<a href="#ShaGI36" class="super">[36]</a>
               
               
            </p>
            <p>A particularly difficult problem in the study of the Smock Alley prompt-books
               arises from the number of different prompt hands. Yet the identification and
               isolation of these hands is most often the only clue to distinguishing the work
               of different individuals in the preparation of a prompt-book. Several
               prompt-books contain as many as five or six principal hands and it is frequently
               hard, sometimes impossible, to assign to its proper hand each prompt-note or
               textual change. The difficulty becomes even greater when, under changed
               conditions imposed by new pens, ink, etc., one tries to identify hands in one
               prompt-book with those appearing in other prompt-books. As in dealing with the
               Padua and 'Nursery' prompt-books, I have assigned all readings to a particular
               hand whenever possible, but with the Smock Alley prompt-books I have more
               frequently been forced to question the exact identification or to admit defeat. 
            </p>
            <p>Eight hands appear in more than one Smock Alley prompt-book. The following table
               will help to establish their interrelationships:<a href="#ShaGI37" class="super">[37]</a></p>
            <ul>HAND A:
               <li><em>Hamlet</em> (Hand I); <em>Lear</em>
                  (Hand I); <em>Macbeth</em> (Hand I); <em>Twelfth Night</em> (Hand I)
               </li>HAND B:
               <li>
                  <em>Hamlet</em> (Hand III); <em>Julius
                     Caesar</em> (acting list); <em>Macbeth</em> (Hand IV);
                  <em>Merry Wives</em> (Hand I); <em>Othello</em> (Hand VI); [Wilson's <em>Belphegor</em>
                  (main prompt hand)]
               </li>HAND C:
               <li><em>Hamlet</em> (Hand II); <em>Henry
                     VIII</em> (Hand I); <em>Macbeth</em> (Hand II); <em>Othello</em> (Hand II); <em>I Henry
                     IV</em> (Hand II)
               </li>HAND D:
               <li><em>Macbeth</em> (Hand III); <em>Othello</em> (Hand I)
               </li>HAND E:
               <li><em>Henry VIII</em> (Hand II); <em>Lear</em>
                  (Hand II); <em>Hamlet</em> (?Hand V)
               </li>HAND F:
               <li><em>Othello</em> (Hand V); <em>I Henry
                     IV</em> (Hand III)
               </li>HAND G:
               <li><em>Hamlet</em> (Hand VI); <em>Merry
                     Wives</em> (Hand III, copyist); [Wilson's <em>Belphegor</em> (copyist)]
               </li>HAND H:
               <li><em>Hamlet</em> (Hand IV); <em>Lear</em>
                  (Hand III); <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em> (Hand II); <em>Twelfth Night</em> (Hand II); <em>Merry
                     Wives</em> (Hand II). This is an intrusive mid-eighteenth-century
                  hand.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This listing leaves two major hands, each of which, so far as I can determine,
               appears in only a single prompt-book: Hand I in <em>Midsummer
                  Night's Dream</em> and Hand I in <em>Comedy of Errors</em>. 
            </p>
            <p>Exact dates for the Smock Alley Shakespeare productions are unfortunately
               impossible to arrive at. The presence of particular actors in certain of the
               plays can be useful in setting date limits, but even such evidence may sometimes
               be ambiguous, the addition of particular actors' names being possible at various
               times after the first use of the prompt-book. With this warning, however, a few
               tentative dates may be suggested. <em>Julius Caesar</em>, as we
               noticed above, can be dated before 1677 and not earlier than 1670; Jeremiah
               Lisle, who played the Cobble,<a href="#ShaGI38" class="super">[38]</a> was not with the
               Smock Alley players before 1670 and died in 1681, and Richards, who played
               Brutus, left for the London stage in the summer of 1676.<a href="#ShaGI39" class="super">[39]</a> Both Lisle and Richards also appear in the Smock Alley <em>Night-Walker</em> cast (which thus also falls between 1670
               and 1676) but they do not appear by name in any of the other Shakespearean
               productions. This fact would seem to suggest that the other productions are
               later, but again the nature of the evidence may be somewhat misleading. For both
               <em>Julius Caesar</em> and <em>The
                  Night-Walker</em> we have more or less complete casts; for the other
               Shakespearean plays we have only occasional names attached to minor roles.
               Richards, then, or even Lisle, may well have taken part in some of these other
               plays; the fact that their names do not occur may simply mean that they did not
               happen to double in a small  part (as Smith
               probably did in <em>Macbeth</em>, for example) and so were not
               particularly singled out for mention by the prompter. Even with this proviso,
               however, it still seems likely that the other Shakespeare productions may be
               grouped after the <em>Julius Caesar</em> cast. 
            </p>
            <p>The appearance of Henry Smith, who died in August, 1682, in <em>Macbeth</em> (Hand III) and <em>Henry VIII</em> (Hand I)
               affords us a definite terminal date for these two plays, and the fact that Smith
               is the only actor there named who also appears in the <em>Julius
                  Caesar</em> cast might be interpreted, always remembering the dangers
               involved, as an indication of some lapse of time between these plays and the <em>Julius Caesar</em> production. It will be noted, however,
               that Smith's name occurs in <em>Macbeth</em> in Hand III and may
               be related to a second state of the prompt-book; in other words the prompt-book
               may represent an earlier production with which Smith had no connection, a
               production of the play essentially unaffected by the influence of D'Avenant's
               version, an influence clearly reflected in the work of Hand III. The presence of
               Totterdale in both <em>Macbeth</em> (Hand III) and <em>Henry VIII</em> (Hand I), though it links these plays with
               <em>Othello</em> (Hand V), does not help in fixing an earlier
               date limit, since, though he is absent from the <em>Julius
                  Caesar</em> cast, he is found in the contemporary, perhaps even earlier, <em>Night-Walker</em> cast. Clark<a href="#ShaGI40" class="super">[40]</a> suggests a date between 1674 and 1682 for <em>Macbeth</em>; I would, on the whole, favor the later rather than the
               earlier limits of this period for both <em>Macbeth</em> and <em>Henry VIII</em>. 
            </p>
            <p><em>Othello</em>, which gives us a greater number of actors' names
               than any of the other plays, the <em>Julius Caesar</em> cast
               excepted, shares Walmesley (Hand V) with the <em>Julius
                  Caesar</em> cast and Totterdale (Hand V), as I noticed above, with <em>Macbeth</em> and <em>Henry VIII</em>. The
               several new names (Trefusis, Freeman, Barnes, and Charles, all in Hand V)
               suggest perhaps that we should place <em>Othello</em> after <em>Macbeth</em> and <em>Henry VIII</em>.
               Unfortunately nothing is known about when any of these new names
                first put in an appearance at Smock Alley,
               though Freeman and Barnes figure in the Smock Alley cast of Wilson's <em>Belphegor</em>, a production which may be dated 1677-78 or
               1682-83.<a href="#ShaGI41" class="super">[41]</a> I would suggest 1680-82 as a
               probable date for <em>Othello</em>. 
            </p>
            <p>The <em>Hamlet</em> prompt-book mentions Trefusis and possibly
               Williams (both Hand VI). If the '&lt;W&gt;illian' who played Laertes was indeed
               the David Williams who figures in the <em>Julius Caesar</em>
               cast, we may claim a terminal date for this prompt-book in 1679, David Williams
               having gone to London early in that year.<a href="#ShaGI42" class="super">[42]</a> Nor
               is the appearance here of Trefusis inconsistent with a date prior to 1679; we
               know nothing of Trefusis' whereabouts before the early 1680's. An early limit
               for the production is indicated by the strong influence throughout the text of
               the 1676 actors' quarto of <em>Hamlet</em>. Thus we may, though
               with proper hesitation, suggest a date between 1676 and 1679 for the Smock Alley
               <em>Hamlet</em>. 
            </p>
            <p>Although the Smock Alley <em>King Lear</em> mentions no actors'
               names, it is linked with the prompt-books already discussed by several prompt
               hands and unquestionably belongs to the same general period. Since, however, it
               gives evidence of influence from Tate's adaptation, it must be dated after 1681. 
            </p>
            <p><em>I Henry IV</em>, of which only a fragment remains, must
               certainly have been produced at Smock Alley some years before 1685, at which
               date Baker, who played Falstaff, was well received on the London stage for his
               performance in that role. The only name mentioned in the surviving half-leaf is
               that of Longmore. It occurs twice: once as 'Longmo' and once as '&lt;&gt;more'
               in a hand which I have called Hand II. Hand II links this prompt-book with <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Othello</em>, <em>Macbeth</em>, and <em>Henry VIII</em>. Clark
               on the evidence here of Longmore's name associates him, probably correctly, with
               Smock Alley before 1685, although any references we have to him as a Smock Alley
               actor date from the 1690's.<a href="#ShaGI43" class="super">[43]</a>
               
               
            </p>
            <p>Using Baker's Falstaff again as an argument for dating, we may also place The <em>Merry Wives</em> prompt-book before 1685. Prompt hand links
               with <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Othello</em>, <em>Macbeth</em>, the <em>Julius Caesar</em> cast,
               and Wilson's <em>Belphegor</em> also support a date in the late
               '70's or early '80's. 
            </p>
            <p>The Smock Alley <em>Twelfth Night</em> also almost certainly
               belongs to this same period. It contains no actors' names, but it is linked with
               <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Lear</em>, and <em>Macbeth</em> by a single prompt hand. 
            </p>
            <p>Three Smock Alley prompt-books remain: <em>Comedy of Errors</em>,
               <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, and <em>Winter's Tale</em>. None of them is strictly speaking a prompt-book and
               none shows evidence of actual use in the theatre. <em>The
                  Winter's Tale</em> is simply an unfinished cutting (to IV.iv.442) with no
               markings of any kind except rough circling for suggested deletions. <em>The Comedy of Errors</em> and <em>Midsummer
                  Night's Dream</em>, although they show signs of a good deal of careful
               preparation, by heavy cutting and rewriting, contain no calls or other
               prompter's notes. Nor can the reviser's hand in either be associated with any of
               the revisers' or prompters' hands in the other Smock Alley prompt-books. 
            </p>
            <p>Certain general characteristics of the Smock Alley promptbooks may be noticed
               here. (1) The usual first step in preparing a play for the stage seems to have
               been a rough preliminary cutting. Such a step may be seen in the Smock Alley <em>Winter's Tale</em>, <em>Midsummer Night's
                  Dream</em>, and <em>Comedy of Errors</em>, none of which, at
               least in their present form, ever reached production; the remains of this
               initial cutting are also clearly marked in the Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em>, and probably in <em>Macbeth</em>. But even in
               this initial step differences in approach must be pointed out. The reviser who
               worked on <em>Winter's Tale</em> did nothing except circle
               passages for deletion (as did the first reviser, I believe, of <em>Hamlet</em>); the reviser of <em>Comedy of
                  Errors</em>, and particularly the reviser of <em>Midsummer
                  Night's Dream</em>, went much further, not only marking cuts but adding new
               lines or rewriting speeches, and, in the case of <em>Midsummer
                  Night's Dream</em>, including scene settings. (2) The
                order of events after the initial cutting
               of the play is difficult to determine. In some cases, the initial cutting was
               subjected to a thorough revision (as in <em>Hamlet</em> and
               probably <em>Macbeth</em>). One hand usually seems to be
               responsible for the advance calls; another hand for the indication of scene
               settings (though in <em>King Lear</em> and <em>Merry Wives</em> the same hand is responsible for both). The calls
               themselves are regularly anticipative, though at no set number of lines in
               advance. They are, moreover, by character name, not as in the 'Nursery' <em>Comedy of Errors</em>, for example, by actor's name. Where
               actors' names occur in the Smock Alley prompt-books they are always associated
               with the character name and they appear only in very minor roles, probably where
               some confusion might arise from doubling. No calls are made at the beginning of
               an act. (3) Advance calls for the act break ('Act ready') occur regularly, and
               in <em>Othello</em> the prompter's note 'ring' is used at the end
               of the act to indicate the point at which the music should begin. (4) The symbol
               <a href="images/.jpg"><img src="images/.gif" alt=""></a> to indicate 'whistle for a change of scene' appears only in <em>Othello</em> (I.iii; II.i, iv; IV.i; V.ii) and in the <em>I Henry IV</em> fragment (II.ii).<a href="#ShaGI44" class="super">[44]</a> The Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em> warns of a
               change of scene by an advance call 'scean' about ten or twelve lines before a
               change is necessary. (5) Point of entry is marked in three of the prompt-books
               by a slanted and crossed line usually in the margin (<em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Othello</em>, <em>I Henry
                  IV</em>); the same symbol is also used in the 'Nursery' <em>Comedy of Errors</em>, the King's Company Sisters, and the unassigned <em>Twelfth Night</em> (mentioned in Group IV above). The
               Shakespearean prompt-books do not use indications of the exact point from which
               an actor enters, though such indications ('E.L.' = East Lower; 'W. up.' =West
               Upper; 'W.L.'=West Lower; 'E upp'= East Upper) occur regularly in the
               contemporary Smock Alley <em>Belphegor</em> MS prompt-book.<a href="#ShaGI45" class="super">[45]</a> (6) Calls for special properties or sound
               effects are usually in a hand (or hands) other than those responsible
                for the scene notations and character
               calls. The same is true of the sporadic appearance of actors' names; except in
               <em>Henry VIII</em>, they are in a different hand from that
               appearing in the character call to which the name is attached. 
            </p>
            <p>One of the most interesting aspects of the Smock Alley prompt-books is the record
               they a: ford of the scenic resources of this company during the 1670's and early
               '80's. Particular aspects of the scenery will be discussed in the separate
               introductions to each play, but it will be useful here to give a complete list
               of the scenes.<a href="#ShaGI46" class="super">[46]</a></p>

                  settings; <em>The Cheats</em> is early enough (1662) to have been
                  acted without change of scene, and its status as a prompt-book is open to
                  question; <em>The Night-Walker</em> does not show evidence of
                  actual prompt use. Of the fourteen Restoration Shakespeare promptbooks, only
                  five are without scene settings (<em>Comedy of Errors</em> and
                  <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, both 'Nursery' plays; <em>Comedy of Errors</em> and <em>Henry VIII</em>,
                  both Smock Alley). Neither <em>Comedy of Errors</em> (Smock
                  Alley) nor <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em> ('Nursery') ever
                  reached production. The fifth is the prompt-book of <em>Twelfth
                     Night</em> of uncertain provenience and date.

                  of Cambridge students who performed Peter Hausted's <em>The Rival

                  Stevenson has been most helpful in correspondence with me on this very difficult
                  matter of dating and I should like to take this opportunity to thank him.

               <p>41. Clark (pp. 80-83) argues for the 1677-78 date; Stevenson (pp.
                  290-293) considers 1682-83 in some respects a more satisfactory date, though
                  admitting the possibility of the earlier period.
