            <h1> Smock Alley <br>Henry VIII <br>Third Folio
               <br>Introduction 
            </h1>
            <p>TERMINAL dates for the Smock Alley <em>Henry VIII</em>
               prompt-book (PB) may be set with some confidence as between
               1674/75 and 1682. John Totterdale, who is called for the
               role of the <em>'third Gentleman'</em> at IV.i.37, seems to
               have begun appearing on the Dublin stage in 1674 or 1675 but
               cannot be traced as acting in Dublin after "the early
               1680's." <a href="#n1" class="super"> [1]</a> and a second actor,
               Henry Smith, who appears as Griffith in V.ii, died in Dublin
               in early August 1682.<a href="#n2" class="super"> [2]</a> Three
               other actors are named: Andrews (as Brandon, I.i.161-164, as
               Gardiner, II.ii. 62, and as a <em>'Gentleman'</em>, III.i
               [opening, to enter at line 14]); Kaine (as the <em>'Old
                  Lady'</em>, V.i.129);<a href="#n3" class="super"> [3]</a>
               and 'Arstedt' (as a 
               
               <em>'Sergeant-at-Armes'</em>, I.i.161-164 ). Of the first
               two actors nothing further is known, and the name of the
               third is almost illegible and resembles no name associated
               with Smock Alley at this time.<a href="#n4" class="super"> [4]</a>
               
            </p>
            <p>Only two hands appear to have worked on the <em>Henry VIII</em>
               PB. Hand I, which is found also in the Smock Alley
               <em>Hamlet</em> (Hands I and II),<a href="#n5" class="super">
                  [5]</a>
               <em>Macbeth</em> (Hands I and II), <em>Othello</em> (Hand
               II), <em>King Lear</em> (Hand I), and <em>I Henry I V</em>
               (Hand II), is responsible for the advance character calls,
               for all but one of the actors' names, occasionally for
               changes in the original handling of a scene (e.g., II.i),
               and, I believe, for most of the initial cutting of the play.
               Hand II, which appears again in the Smock Alley <em>King
                  Lear</em> (Hand II) and, perhaps, in <em>Hamlet</em>
               (Hand V), is associated with a number of verbal
               substitutions modernizing or simplifying Shakespeare's
               language, one character substitution (V.i.79), some revision
               of Hand I's scene arrangements (e.g., I.i.54-100; see
               <em>Textual cuts</em>), and probably one actor's
               name (II.ii.62). 
            </p>
            <p> The work of Hands I and II seems to represent different stages
               in the "production" of the play, but whether the play was
               ever produced in some form resembling Hand I's initial
               version must remain a question, even though Hand I's call
               for a particular actor (Totterdale) in a part of IV.i that
               was later cut would appear to suggest an earlier performance
               in which Totterdale acted the role of the <em>'third
                  Gentleman'</em> (see <em>Textual cuts</em>). 
            </p>
            <p>One of the confused (and confusing) aspects of this promptbook is
               Hand I's apparently abandoned attempt to get rid of the
               character of Campeius. In II.ii, Hand I substitutes the
               Bishop of Lincoln; in II.iv he first gives Campeius' lines
               (64-68) to Lincoln and then restores Campeius, leaving
               Campeius' lines 121-24 untouched but assigning Campeius'
               speech at 230 to Wolsey; in III.i, he omits Campeius and
               either cuts his lines or assigns them to Wolsey, adjusting
               the dialogue to allow for the omission of Campeius through
               line 139, but abandoning such adjustment for the remainder
               of the scene. In each instance Campeius appears to have been
               restored: in II.ii by Hand II, in II.iv by Hand I, while in
               III.i Hand I's failure to carry through to the end of the
               scene his adjustment of the dialogue 
                presumably indicates that he finally
               decided to retain Campeius. <a href="#n6" class="super"> [6]</a>
               Since almost all the changes in II.ii and III.i made by Hand
               I to allow for the omission of Campeius remain uncanceled,
               the prompt-book, so far as these two scenes are concerned,
               is rendered seriously misleading if considered as a
               functionable prompt-book. 
            </p>
            <p> The <em>Henry VIII</em> PB is unusual in another respect. Except
               for <em>The Comedy of Errors</em> and <em>The Winter's
                  Tale</em>, neither of which was, I believe, ever
               produced, it is the only other Smock Alley prompt-book that
               does not contain scene settings. This absence of scene
               notation may, perhaps, suggest that some kind of single set
               was used throughout, a manner of staging not impossible in
               <em>Henry VIII</em>, which calls for no very radical
               changes of scene. Curiously, the three earliest published
               theatre versions (1734, 1762, 1773; see below), like the
               Smock Alley prompt-book, are also without any indication of
               setting or scene changes. While, however, it is possible
               that the single-setting explanation may be arguable for this
               comparatively early Smock Alley production, the absence of
               specific scene notations in the eighteenth-century acting
               texts is almost certainly misleading, at least so far as
               London productions were concerned, since we know that when
               Sir William Davenant revived <em>Henry VIII</em> for the
               Duke's Company at the theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields in
               December of 1663 the play was rather lavishly presented,
               "being all new Cloath'd and new Scenes."<a href="#n7" class="super">
                  [7]</a>
               
            </p>
            <p>The <em>Henry VIII</em> PB is fairly heavily cut. The equivalent
               of 595 lines, a figure that includes the Prologue and
               Epilogue, are finally cut (46 lines originally cut being
               restored, mostly by Hand II), leaving a play of about 2,316
               lines.<a href="#n8" class="super"> [8]</a> Compared,
               however, with the three eighteenth-century acting texts
               mentioned above and John Philip Kemble's early
               nineteenth-century acting version, the Smock Alley acting
               text is comparatively long: Powell (1734), roughly 2,078
               lines; Garrick ( 1762), 1,767 lines; Bell (1773), 1,733
               lines; and Kemble (1804) 1,666 lines.<a href="#n9" class="super">
                  [9]</a>
               
                The play, of course,
               makes much of its appeal through pageantry and show of
               various kinds, all of which consume precious stage time. It
               is therefore surprising that the <em>Henry VIII</em> PB, as
               in Davenant's earlier production, <a href="#n10" class="super">
                  [10]</a> is the only one of these theatre texts
               that retains "The Vision" in IV.i. 
            </p>
            <p> The principal cuts are as follows: I.i.54-100 (conversation
               between Buckingham and Norfolk on the state of the kingdom
               and its relation to Cardinal Wolsey); I.iv.1-34 (chitchat
               preceding Wolsey's entry); II.i.1-54 (conversation of
               '<em>two Gentlemen</em>' about Buckingham's sentence
               and Wolsey's hand in it); II.i.136-169 (further comment from
               the '<em>two Gentlemen</em>'); II.iii.1-32 (conversation
               between Anne Bullen and an '<em>Old Lady</em>' on the
               desirability of being a queen [lines 33-49 were also
               originally cut but restored by Hand II]); IV.i. 1-117 (the
               lines of the three '<em>Gentlemen</em>' [i.e., all of the
               dialogue], leaving only the 'show' of 'The Order of the
               Coronation.'); V.i.1-55 (discussion between Gardiner and Sir
               Thomas Lovell reporting the plot against Cranmer and
               Cromwell). A glance at the section on <em>Textual cuts</em>
               will show that, except for the second (I.iv.1-34), these
               cuts are closely reflected in the four acting texts referred
               to above. A similar closeness may frequently be observed in
               the shorter deletions as well. Such comparative continuity
               in the cutting of the play suggests a fairly unbroken acting
               tradition possibly stemming from Davenant's 1663 London
               revival; indeed, Downes claims that Thomas Betterton, who
               played the king, was specially instructed in the role by
               Davenant himself, "who had it from Old Mr. <em>Lowen</em>,
               that had his instructions from Mr. <em>Shakespear</em>
               himself.''<a href="#n11" class="super"> [11]</a> The Folio
               Prologue and Epilogue are unmarked in any way but were
               almost certainly omitted, as they are in the four later
               acting texts mentioned above.

               <p> 9. The <em>Henry VIII</em> Smock Alley PB has been
                  compared throughout with these four acting texts (see
                  Collations, particularly <em>Textual cuts</em>). J. Powell
                  is the Dublin publisher (1734) of a text that claims to
                  present the play 'As it is acted . . . at the Theatres of
                  London and Dublin.' Garrick refers to a version of the play
                  prepared for production at Drury Lane and published in 1762
                  (Garrick himself did not play in the production). Bell
                  refers to the play as published by John Bell in Vol. IV
                  (1773) of his edition of <em>Shakespeare's Plays, As they
                     are now performed at the Theatres Royal in
                     London</em>, a slightly shortened and revised
                  version of Garrick's 1762 text. John Philip Kemble's acting
                  text (1804) is the first to give scene settings (Theobald,
                  Vol. V, 1733, was the first scholarly editor to introduce
                  scene settings).

                  <p>It is very difficult to identify the hand or
                     hands responsible for the cutting. My general
                     assumption is that Hand I did most of the initial
                     cutting (by circling lines to be deleted) at the
                     same time that he entered the advance character
                     calls, etc. and that Hand II then revised Hand I's
                     cuts, restored a few lines here and there,
                     proceeded to do some further quite substantial
                     cutting, and crisscrossed many of Hand I's
                     originally deleted lines to make their omission
                     clearer. It is possible, however, that some other
                     hand did the initial cutting by circling the lines
                     to be deleted and that Hands I and II only revised
                     the cutting as this hypothetical third hand had
                     left it. I associate the crisscrossing of many of
                     the circled cuts with Hand II because restored
                     lines are only circled and never crisscrossed. For
                     example, in II.iii, where Hand I, originally
                     intending to retain lines 1-49 (as shown by the
                     position of the advance call for Anne Bullen and
                     the Lady placed at II.ii.117), changed his mind
                     and circled line 1-49 for deletion; Hand II then
                     restored lines 33 ('Nay, . . .)-49, placing 'Stet'
                     in the left margin but crisscrossing lines 1-33
                     ('... it.') to distinguish them as still being
                     deleted (compare the treatment of II.iv.18-34).
                     Occasionally, shorter deletions are made by
                     crossing through, but by what hand is uncertain.
