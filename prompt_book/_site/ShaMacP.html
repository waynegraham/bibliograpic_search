               <h1>Introduction<br> Smock Alley <em>Macbeth</em><br> Third Folio
               </h1>
               <p>THE Smock Alley prompt-book of Macbeth has suffered a somewhat adventurous
                  career. After the play was separated from the original copy of the Third Folio
                  (1664) by Halliwell Phillipps, <a href="#n1" class="super">[1]</a> four pages (pp. 711,
                  sig. 3O4; 714 [misnumbered], sig. 3O6<em>V</em>; 719, sig. 3P3; 722,
                  sig. 3P4<em>V</em>) were exhibited in the "Rustic Wigwam" at
                  Hollingbury Copse, Brighton, and the last page of the play (p. 729, sig. 3Q2)
                  was eventually bound up with the Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em>, the first page of
                  <em>Hamlet</em> (p. 730, sig. 3Q2<em>V</em>) being the verso of
                  the last page of Macbeth. <a href="#n2" class="super">[2]</a> All but the last page
                  found their way to the Folger Shakespeare Library, where they were reassembled.
                  <a href="#n3" class="super">[3]</a> The last page has only recently come to light
                  with the discovery of the Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em> prompt book in the
                  Halliwell Phillipps collection of the University of Edinburgh Library. All these
                  leaves unfortunately bear the marks of their exhibition: wavy ink lines running
                  vertically through the text on the side of the leaf not intended for exhibition.
                  The damage to the last page of Macbeth is especially heavy (see below, pp. 6-7)
                  and indicates that the first page of <em>Hamlet</em> was also exhibited at some
                  stage in its history, probably at Hollingbury Copse.
                  
                  
               </p>
               <p>Professor R. C. Bald's identification of 'Smyth' (Hand III), who plays Seyton in
                  V.iii, with the Smock Alley actor Henry Smith who died in 1682 sets a definite
                  date after which what may be considered as probably the first acted form of the
                  Smock Alley prompt book cannot have been prepared. <a href="#n4" class="super">[4]</a>
                  The only other actors named are John Totterdale (at V.v.8, Hand III), who also
                  played in Henry VIII and Othello, and 'farlow' (at III.i.22, 101-104, Hand ?III
                  ). Nothing further is certainly known of Farlow, but Totterdale seems to have
                  been acting in Dublin from about 1674 to 1688. <a href="#n5" class="super">[5]</a>
                  Totterdale's name, therefore, would seem to suggest an early limit of about 1674
                  for this form of the prompt book. Further possible narrowing of the two limits
                  (1674 and 1682) will be discussed later. 
               </p>
               <p>It is possible, as Professor Bald points out, <a href="#n6" class="super">[6]</a> to
                  distinguish what appear to be three layers in the prompt markings and four
                  principal hands. Hand I (which appears as Hand I in <em>Hamlet</em>,
                  <em>Lear</em>, and <em>Twelfth Night</em> and as Hand II in <em>I Henry
                     IV</em>) does nothing but mark the scene settings. Hand II, probably the
                  earliest of the prompt hands, indicates the characters to be called and seems
                  responsible for much of the cutting and occasional textual changes. It appears
                  again as Hand II in <em>Hamlet</em> and <em>Othello</em> and is perhaps the same
                  hand responsible for the <em>Julius Caesar</em> couplet. <a href="#n7" class="super">[7]</a> Hand III, another prompt hand and the same as Hand I in
                  <em>Othello</em>, marks a second stage in the preparation of the play and is
                  largely associated with bringing the performance, as originally outlined by Hand
                  II, into closer conformity with certain aspects of D'Avenant's version of
                  Macbeth (published 1674), particularly in III.iii, IV.i, and V.viii. Hand IV, a
                  peculiarly coarse and heavily formed hand, occasionally makes changes in Hand
                  III's notations, cuts a few lines, supplies prompt notes on off-stage effects,
                  and tidies up generally. It occurs also in <em>Hamlet</em>
                   (Hand III), <em>Merry Wives</em> (Hand I),
                  <em>Othello</em> (Hand VI), and the <em>Julius Caesar</em> acting list and
                  is the principal prompt hand in the Smock Alley <em>Belphegor</em> manuscript
                  prompt-book. It is also possible to distinguish a fifth hand (Hand V) in
                  connection with a few textual emendations near the beginning of the play which
                  appear to be echoes of Pope's text (1723). <a href="#n8" class="super">[8]</a> What
                  seem to be other hands occur occasionally, but I have been unable to associate
                  them with any of the hands in the other Smock Alley prompt-books. In the
                  collation which follows all changes and additions and most deletions are either
                  assigned to one of the five hands listed above (sometimes with a query) or
                  marked as by an unidentified hand. The attempt to determine the hands
                  responsible for the deletions (by circling, crossing through, and
                  criss-crossing) is based on a study of the various inks usually associated with
                  a particular hand. There is, of course, considerable danger in this method, and
                  I have tried to indicate those cases where the evidence seemed especially
                  ambiguous. 
               </p>
               <p>In the collation I have compared the Smock Alley Macbeth with the following stage
                  or stage related versions: (1) the Padua prompt-book (see Volume 1 of this
                  series; referred to as Padua PB); (2) Sir William D'Avenant's adaptation, 1674
                  (edited by Christopher Spencer in <em>Five Restoration Adaptations of
                     Shakespeare</em>, Urbana, 1965; referred to as D'Avenant) and the Yale
                  manuscript of D'Avenant's adaptation (edited by Christopher Spencer,
                  <em>D'Avenant's "Macbeth" from the Yale Manuscript</em>, New Haven, 1961;
                  referred to as Yale MS, but not included in the collation unless differing
                  significantly from the 1674 printed text). (3) The Douai manuscript, 1694 (in
                  the Douai Public Library, MS 7.87, fols. 171-209; referred to as Douai MS).<a href="#n9" class="super">[9]</a> (4) The Garrick version, 1744 (in Bell's
                  <em>Shakespeare</em>, 1773, Vol. I; referred to as Bell).<a href="#n10" class="super">[10]</a> (5) The John Lee version, Edinburgh, 1753 (referred to as Lee);
                  (6) The Lee Edward Salmon prompt-book  (in a
                  copy of the 1753 edition, now in the Harvard Theatre Collection, marked by
                  Edward Salmon, the prompter, and belonging to West Digges, who played the role
                  of Macbeth in Edinburgh on 26 December 1757; referred to as Lee Salmon PB, but
                  only where it differs from Lee). <a href="#n11" class="super">[11]</a> I have also
                  included the cuts indicated in the Collier Perkins Second Folio, 1632 (referred
                  to as Collier MS). 
               </p>
               <p>Two distinct versions of Macbeth emerge from the work of Hands II and III. Hand
                  II seems to have blocked the play out, making a few verbal changes (I.iii.120,
                  145-146; I.vi.9; III.i. 16-17, 28), marking certain passages or scenes (III.vi,
                  V.ii) for cutting, a total of roughly 163 lines, and writing in the prompt calls
                  for the characters. He regularly omits the characters of Angus and Lennox,
                  except for one occasion each (V.i.63-64 and IV.ii. 125), when they were
                  inadvertently, I think, included. In the General Introduction to this series
                  (I,i,19) I suggested, following R. C. Bald, <a href="#n12" class="super">[12]</a> that
                  Hand II's version may represent the original form in which Smock Alley played
                  Macbeth. This view I no longer consider seriously tenable. It is much more
                  likely that Hand II's version represents a preliminary draft for prompt use and
                  that this "prepared book" was then taken over by Hand III and further adapted
                  for the stage with additional emphasis on D'Avenant's version. An analogous
                  situation may be found in the Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em>, where, I have
                  suggested, possibly the same hand (Hand II) performed essentially the same kind
                  of preliminary spadework. <a href="#n13" class="super">[13]</a>
                  
               </p>
               <p>Hand III initiates less cutting than Hand II (roughly 127 lines as compared with
                  some 163),<a href="#n14" class="super">[14]</a> although in a number of cases he
                  reinforces Hand II's suggested cuts by further marks of deletion. On the other
                  side, his individual textual revisions are much more numerous, particularly in
                  III.iii, IV.i, and V.viii, scenes in which D'Avenant's influence is particularly
                  marked. Hand II's  few verbal changes suggest
                  some vague knowledge of D'Avenant, and his cuts sometimes parallel those in
                  D'Avenant's version. Hand III's changes, however, quite apart from the three
                  scenes noted above, reflect a closer recollection of D'Avenant's wording,
                  although almost invariably with slight verbal inaccuracies or changes. This
                  strongly suggests that Hand III worked from memory, without having a text of
                  D'Avenant's version to consult.<a href="#n15" class="super">[15]</a> Such a view might
                  be considered one reason why the Third Folio text was employed as a prompt-book.
                  But all the Smock Alley productions of Shakespeare used the Third Folio text as
                  a source for the prompt-book. It is, moreover, conceivable that the company
                  preferred Shakespeare's basic text, using D'Avenant only in those scenes (the
                  murder of Banquo and the handling of the Apparitions) where his revision did not
                  interfere materially with the original. A somewhat similar case occurs in the
                  Smock Alley <em>King Lear</em>, in which Shakespeare's text is used until V.ii,
                  at which point some form of Tate's happy ending appears to have been tacked on. 
               </p>
               <p>The suggested absence of a printed text of D'Avenant's version, first published
                  in 1674 but performed as early as 1664, may also be advanced as an argument for
                  placing the Smock Alley production of Macbeth at the earliest possible
                  date--Totterdale's advent in the company in 1674. If, indeed, a printed copy of
                  D'Avenant's text was literally not available, this would explain the apparent
                  reliance of Hands II and III on recollections of the London performances. While
                  an early limit (1674) must be allowed as a possibility, I still incline to the
                  opinion I expressed in the General Introduction to this series (I,i,19): between
                  1674 and 1682, with some preference for a later rather than an earlier date. 
               </p>
               <p>Hand IV seems certainly to be the latest of the main prompt hands. Although it is
                  principally concerned with prompt notations, particularly off-stage effects or
                  special business, e.g., I.iii.3-4; II.iv.10-13, 21; III.ii.22-23; III.iii
                  (opening); III.v (opening and end); V.vii (opening), it makes a few cuts (about
                  38 lines, limited to IV.iii, V.iii, V.iv, and V.viii), one change of scene
                  (IV.i), and occasional verbal substitutions ( IV.iii.8,
                   123, 191-192; V.v.11). Hand IV also restores
                  Folio 'Rosse' for Hand III's'Macduffe' in I.ii.45 s.d. and I.iii.88 s.d. (from
                  D'Avenant) and Folio 'Saward' for Hand III's 'Rosse' in V.vii.4 s.d. (D'Avenant,
                  'Lennox'). There is, I believe, some evidence to suggest that Hand IV worked on
                  the prompt-book at two different times. The changes made in Hand III's notations
                  and some other notations are written in a faded black-brown ink, while those
                  calls which seem merely to tidy up Hand III's work are generally in a light
                  brown ink. It seems possible, therefore, that some of Hand IV's changes may
                  reflect a somewhat later version of the play. But the evidence is tenuous,
                  sometimes uncertain, and resists any definite conclusion. 
               </p>
               <p>It is difficult to give a very satisfactory account of the total number of lines
                  cut in the Smock Alley <em>Macbeth</em>. But as the play finally emerged under
                  Hand IV about 328 lines seem to have been deleted from the original and about
                  five lines, which do not merely substitute for deletions (see III.iii.11-22;
                  V.vii.11; V.viii.32-34), added. Also probably another twenty lines (the second
                  (?) song from D'Avenant's version called for in II.iv.10-13, 21) must be
                  included as an addition. All this leaves a production of about 1,781 lines,
                  somewhat shorter than the Padua PB, D'Avenant, Douai MS, Garrick, Lee, and
                  Lee-Salmon versions.<a href="#n16" class="super">[l6]</a> The principal cuts are as
                  follows: II.iii.5-23, 28 ('of three . . .')-46 (the Porter scene); III.vi (the
                  scene of comment between Lennox and a Lord); IV.ii.30-64, 79-85 (the last part
                  of the scene of Lady Macduff's murder); IV.ii.117-123 ('Devilish . . .
                  detraction.'), 125-137 ('I am . . . Quarrel.'), 139 s.d.-159 (' . . . Grace. ')
                  (parts of the Malcolm Macduff interview); and V.ii (scene of comment by
                  Macbeth's enemies). 
               </p>
               <p>The final scene (V.viii) requires special comment. This scene occurs on the last
                  page of <em>Macbeth</em> (p. 729, sig. 3Q2 ) and has been defaced by the
                  nineteenth-century exhibitor. In addition to double verticle lines down each
                  column, two of Hand II's advance calls, Hand III's added lines at the bottom of
                  the page, the running title, and the catchword have been crossed through, each
                  with a single pen stroke. All these deletions must, I think,
                   be "credited" to the vandal exhibitor. They
                  are made more neatly, if that is a virtue, than the usual run of deletions in
                  this prompt-book. If this explanation is accepted, the general intention in the
                  final scene is clear enough, although the cutting in lines 35-53 is somewhat
                  confusing. Even so, however, the scene as here developed does nothing to clear
                  up the difficulty in the Folio text as to where Macbeth dies, on- or off-stage.
                  Here, as in the Folio, he seems to die on-stage, with a line lifted from
                  D'Avenant's version of the scene in which he does indeed die on-stage. At this
                  point, Macduff, with a line original to the Smock Alley prompt-book 'Soe may all
                  tyrants fall.' exits, re-entering immediately after the entrance of Malcolm,
                  Siward, Ross, etc. (lines 35-53 being cut) with Macbeth's head. Unless he cuts
                  it off before exiting, where does Macduff get the head? At best this suggests an
                  awkward bit of stage business, all the more surprising in the Smock Alley
                  production in view of D'Avenant's handling of the matter, by more decorously
                  substituting Macbeth's sword, which Macduff takes from the dying Macbeth just
                  before his exit and produces triumphantly on his re-entry some lines later. Was
                  the taste of an Irish audience more Elizabethan than Augustan? 
               </p>
               <p>In a number of instances the changes made in the Smock Alley prompt-book parallel
                  those found both in the earlier Padua prompt-book and in eighteenth-century
                  productions; all such parallels are recorded in the running notes to the
                  collation. It should be noticed, however, that the attitude here dictating the
                  cutting in the Porter scene differs from that at work in the Padua prompt-book.
                  In Smock Alley "decorum" and D'Avenant are pretty clearly responsible, although
                  I do not believe that there is otherwise much evidence of a desire to "refine"
                  Macbeth except in the matter of language. As usual in Restoration versions
                  (contrast the Padua prompt-book), Shakespeare's diction and syntax have been
                  simplified, sometimes, but not always, with the aid of D'Avenant (e.g.,
                  I.iii.55-57, 120, 145-146; II.iii.131-133; II.iv.40; III.i.16-17, 110;
                  III.iv.60, 75, 103, 105, 106; IV.i.69, 90, 92-94; IV.ii.75; IV.iii.8, 133,
                  191-192; V.iv.11; V.Viii.14, 32-34), or "poetic" passages simply deleted (e.g.,
                  I.iii.125-126, 137-142; I.vi.3-9; I.vii.2-12; II.iii.135-138; III.i.122-126;
                  IV.iii.117-123, 125-137, 171-173). The desire to clarify what seemed involved,
                  difficult, or obsolete accounts for a large number of the changes and cuts, and
                  sometimes the poetic quality of the play 
                  suffers though considerably less so than in D'Avenant's "flattened" adaptation. 
               </p>
               <p>Two further points may be mentioned. Hand III's importation of Banquo into II.iv
                  in the place of the Old Man is so far as I know unique to the Smock Alley
                  production. His presence there may perhaps be explained by the implied inclusion
                  of the Witches in Hand IV's call for a song and dance at lines 4-5 and 10-13,
                  since Banquo would be a more suitable spectator for this extra effect than an
                  anonymous Old Man. In V.iii.36, 48, and V.v.51-52, Hand IV deletes the
                  references to Macbeth's armor (missing, however, the first one at V.iii.33-34),
                  and Hand III cuts the reference to his shield at V.viii.32-34. Such deletions
                  point to a costuming of Macbeth more in keeping with Restoration military dress
                  than with Shakespeare's conception, a view borne out by several
                  eighteenth-century theatrical paintings and engravings.<a href="#n17" class="super">[17]</a>
                  
               </p>
               <p>The scenes employed in the Smock Alley Macbeth are for the most part stock: Court
                  (I.ii,iv,vi; III.i,iv; V.i), Towne (II.iv,deleted; IV.iii; V.ii), Groue
                  (III.iii; V.iv), Castle (V.v), and Chamber (II.i; III.iv, deleted). These scenes
                  all appear in other Smock Alley plays,<a href="#n18" class="super">[18]</a> but three
                  scenes are found only in Macbeth: Rock (I.i,iii; II.iv; III.v; IV.i, deleted),
                  Garden (I.v; IV.ii), and Caue (IV.i). The 'Rock' scene is regularly associated
                  with the Witches and must have been specially prepared for this play. It is
                  possible that the 'Caue' scene substituted by Hand IV in IV.i represents a
                  refinement introduced at perhaps some later date. The only setting which raises
                  any particular question is the use of 'Towne' for the interview between Malcolm
                  and Macduff (IV.iii), a scene which according to Shakespeare's text is supposed
                  to take place at the court of Edward the Confessor in England. Possibly some
                  slight influence of the unity of place may be detected here and in D'Avenant,
                  who, curiously enough, sets the scene in Birnam Wood.

                     notes (p. 289) that Mrs. Elizabeth Farlowe or Farlee was a member of the King's
                     company. She disappears from the London stage after April, 1678 (see <em>The

                     Mrs. Farlowe played the role of the Servant. If so, this would place the date of
                     the Smock Alley production between 1678 and 1682.

                        V.ii. Lee retains Angus, but Lee-Salmon PB deletes him here and
                        elsewhere; both retain Ross. Gentleman (Bell) remarks that at Covent

                        these lines is uncertain. In what seems to be the final form, 5 ('Here's
                        . . . ' )-23 and 28 ('of three . . . ')-46 were cut. Judging by the inks
                        used, Hand II first deletes, by circling, the whole of 1-46, then
                        changes his mind and marks both circled sections with 'stet' and
                        'stett'. Hand III then crisscrosses 5-23 and 28-46 for deletion, adding
                        'to sle&lt;ep&gt;' at the end of 27 to complete the sense. Hand IV
                        tidies things up by placing an advance call for Macduff and Ross at
                        II.ii.52 (deleting Hand II's call at the beginning of scene iii) and an
                        advance call for Macbeth at II.ii.74. Apparently Hand II neglected to
                        mark an advance call for Macbeth; however, see above, II.iii (opening).
                        The order of events as here described presents certain problems, but I
                        am unable to offer any more satisfactory alternative. Padua PB cuts the
                        whole of the Porter's soliloquy; D'Avenant also cuts the soliloquy,
                        reduces the Porter's role to one line (he, here called Servant, and
                        Lennox enter together and after three lines Macduff enters), and
                        replaces 23-46 with eleven lines 
                        between Lennox and Macduff based on F lines 59-66; Douai MS reduces the
                        Porter's soliloquy to 'P: here's a knocking indeed: who's there in the
                        name of belzebub? anon; anon; I am coming. (Opens the doore.)' and omits
                        27-46 ('and drink . . . him.'); Bell cuts everything down to Macduff's
                        entry (24), the Servant, who has opened the '<em>door</em>' to Macduff
                        and Lennox, being given F 26-27 ('Faith . . . cock:'), and then adds
                        Lennox's speech from F (59-66). These last two speeches are in italics,
                        and Gentleman (Bell) remarks: ". . . and the Italic lines, by
                        transposition, judiciously introduced to give <em>Macbeth</em> time for
                        change of appearance, of which, even now, he is allowed too little.";
                        Lee cuts the Porter's soliloquy, bringing Lennox on alone (Lee-Salmon PB
                        notes 'PS' ), '<em>who knocks at the chamber door several times pretty
                           hard, then a servant opens it</em>.' (Lee-Salmon PB adds 'OP'),
                        follows D'Avenant's opening two speeches, inserts F 47 ('Is . . .
                        stirring?'), and adds: '<em>Serv</em>. Not yet, Sir, but he'll scarce
                        lye late; he's of an active spirit, that never suffers his body to lye
                        still when once his mind is up. / <em>Len</em>. Well, say I wait his
                        leisure. / <em>Serv</em>. I will, Sir.' Collier MS shows points of
                        resemblance to Smock Alley PB, since it cuts lines 5-22 ('Here's . . .
                        Bonfire.'), 27-46 ( 'And Drink . . . him.').

                        setting from 'Towne' to 'Rock' as the result of what seems to be an
                        appearance of the Witches later in the scene at Macduff's entrance (20)
                        and suggests that "at least one" of D'Avenant's witch songs was here
                        used (see below, 10-13, 21). Of the two witch
                         songs (D'Avenant, II.v) probably
                        the second is the more likely choice, since it alone is followed by a
                        dance in D'Avenant's version (the first sixteen lines of the song also
                        appeared in the 1673 quarto of <em>Macbeth</em>, interpolated between
                        scenes iii and iv, which is otherwise substantially a reprint of F1).
                        The substitution of Banquo for the Old Man in PB may also perhaps be
                        explained by the importation of the Witches, since their song might seem
                        more suitable for Banquo's ears, though it should be noted that the
                        directions implying the Witches are in Hand IV. In D'Avenant the scene
                        is carried by Lennox and Seyton, down to Macduff's entrance; nor do the
                        witch songs appear in this scene. They are part of the following scene
                        (II.v), a scene ('<em>An Heath</em>.') almost entirely D'Avenant's own
                        creation, and are directed at Macduff and Lady Macduff. Bell, Lee retain
                        Shakespeare's scene with Ross and the Old Man, but place it at the
                        beginning of Act III, inserting a scene with all the Witch business, but
                        minus the Macduffs, from D'Avenant II.v. Bell, Lee-Salmon PB exit the
                        Old Man just before Macduff's entry. Clearly PB, Bell, Lee have one aim
                        in mind: entertainment at any cost. Lee gives no scene setting; in Bell
                        '<em>The SCENE changes to a Wood. Thunder and Lightning</em>.'.

                        this date depends, I assume, on dating the <em>Macbeth</em> PB somewhat
                        earlier than I believe likely. See Introduction, p. 2. Farlow here plays
                        the Servant, and the position of the advance call at 22 suggests that he
                        was intended to enter about 44 (as in the Padua PB); editors, from Rowe
                        on (followed by Bell, Lee), assume the Servant to be one of the F

                        and writes 'two' above. This scene has been radically cut about by Hand
                        III, largely to bring it into line with D'Avenant's version. Originally
                        the scene was planned as written; Hand II's calls for 'Murtherers' at
                        III.ii.44 and 'Banquo / ffleans' at the beginning of scene iii indicate
                        this (though the number of the 'Murtherers' is ambiguous). As Hand III
                        sets the scene up, Banquo and Fleance cross the stage first and are
                        immediately followed by the 'two' Murderers, whose dialogue has been
                        considerably cut to resemble D'Avenant's. The Murderers follow Banquo
                        and Fleance off-stage and the scene ends. R. C. Bald (<em>PMLA</em>, LVI
                        [1941], 377) is surely mistaken when he says "it is interesting to note
                        that, while Davenant makes the actual murder occur off-stage, in the
                        Dublin version Banquo and Fleance do not even come on beforehand." In
                        D'Avenant the three Murderers enter first, speak nine lines, and exit;
                        then Banquo and Fleance enter, speak five lines, and exit; the Murderers
                        re-enter, speak four lines, and go out after Banquo and Fleance;
                        finally, Fleance, pursued by the Murderers, re-enters on the run and
                        throws a single line at the audience. Bell follows F1 (though with some
                        cutting) down to 18 (' . . . Slave!') and cuts the remainder of the
                        Murderers' lines; Banquo dies on stage. Lee follows a heavily cut
                        version of F1 down to the entrance of Banquo and Fleance and turns to
                        D'Avenant for their speeches; after their exit, the Murderers (First and
                        Second) are given an original line each and then pursue Banquo and
                        Fleance off-stage; finally, Fleance re-enters to deliver D'Avenant's
                        single line.

                        does not cancel the F s.d. at 38, nor does it reassign Hecate's speech
                        at 39. D'Avenant, who went in for all the witches he could get, retains
                        the three extra witches, as do Douai MS and Bell. Lee goes even further,
                        reading the s.d. at 38 as '<em>Enter</em> Hecate <em>and all the singing
                           Witches</em>.' and assigning the parts of the song in D'Avenant's
                        version specifically to the 'singing Witches'. D'Avenant (also in the
                        Yale MS) assigns the last part only of 61 to a fourth witch, but the
                        context makes it clear that he really means Hecate; Douai MS, Bell, Lee
                        do not follow him.

                        entirely cut out. The scene was originally planned

                        traps. In a note to the first edition of Bell (1773, p.48), a note
                        dropped in the second edition, Gentleman remarks: "In a very bad
                        alteration of this play, by <em>Betterton</em> [i.e., D'Avenant], he has
                        hit upon what we think an emendation; that is, making the witches
                        deliver all the prophecies; by which the surfeiting quantity of
                        trapwork, ghosts, phantomes, &amp;c. is judiciously lessened."

                        whole scene. Gentleman (Bell) comments on this scene: "Here

                        in the preceding scene, required relaxation, has given us a most
                        trifling superfluous dialogue, between Lady <em>Macduff</em>,
                        <em>Rosse</em>, and her son, merely that another murder may be
                        committed, on the stage too. We heartily concur in, and approve of,
                        striking out the greatest part of it." In the second edition (1774), he
                        drops this note but adds: "The character of Lady <em>Macduff</em>, and
                        consequently this scene, is entirely omitted, at some theatres, as
                        unnecessary to representation, the fatal catastrophe of the family being
                        finely introduced in another part of this act."

                        This cut is obviously the result of omitting Lady Macduff's son, but the

                        untouched. D'Avenant substitutes 'Heaven protect you.'; Douai MS retains

                        by about 77 lines in Padua PB; D'Avenant reduces Shakespeare's 240 lines
                        to 167 (divided into two scenes, IV.iii and IV.v); Douai MS omits about
                        10 lines; Bell, according to Gentleman's note, omits about 80 lines,
                        "which retained, would render it painfully tedious"; Lee keeps as a
                        single scene but reduces the lines to roughly 148. In view of all this,

                        (Bell) is pungent and to the point: "The author has here lugged in, by
                        neck and heels, a doctor, for the strange purpose of paying a gross
                        compliment to that royal line, which ridiculously arrogated a power of

                        written partly across F '<em>Scena</em>' and is made because of the
                        dropping of the Doctor in the opening F s.d. Another call for the
                        Doctor, also by Hand ?IV, appears directly opposite Hand IV's call,
                        after  F '<em>Tertia</em>.', but has
                        been heavily smudged out with ink. See below.

                              Attendants</em>.]</a> Hand ?IV lightly crosses out F
                        '<em>Doctor</em>,'. Hand II seems to have planned the scene as in F
                        (see above, V.ii.25). When, however, scene ii was cut, by Hand ?III, it
                        became necessary to change the Doctor's entrance to avoid an exit at the
                        end of V.i and immediate re-entry at the beginning at V.iii. The initial
                        move to get rid of scene ii has been attributed to Hand III because the
                        Doctor's entrance at 33-34 is partly in Hand III ('Enter [<em>Hand
                           IV</em>] Doc&lt;tor&gt; [<em>Hand III</em>]') and would seem to
                        suggest that Hand III, therefore, had something to do with the cutting
                        of scene ii. Such an explanation supposes that Hand III allowed Hand
                        II's call for Macbeth and the Doctor at V.ii.15 to serve, neglecting to
                        cancel the call for the Doctor at that point. Why the call for the
                        Doctor, tentatively assigned to Hand ?IV, at the beginning of scene iii
                        was deleted (if it was not accidentally smudged) is not clear. D'Avenant
                        omits the Doctor; Bell, Lee enter him at 37, essentially as in PB (the
                        first edition of Bell, 1773, accidentally retained him in the opening
                        s.d.).

                        be intended to mark the point of the Doctor's actual entrance. This is
                        the first of three cuts relating to Macbeth's armor (see below, 48 and
                        v.51-52), and it would seem that the intention was to dress Macbeth in
                        some costume more nearly contemporary; if so, then 33-34, above, were
                        overlooked. Note that the reference to Macbeth's shield at V.viii.32-34
                        is part of a cut by Hand III. That this was the intention, however, is
                        suggested by the deletion of all references to armor in D'Avenant,
                        followed by Lee (except for the reference to 'Hamess' in V.v.51-52);
                        Bell retains the references to armor, indicating, perhaps, a retum to
                        more historical costuming (see, however, p. 8, note 17).

                        This call is crossed through, but probably by the nineteenth-century
                        exhibitor. Earlier cancelled calls are more roughly scratched through or
                        blotted. All the deletions on this final page are made with a single pen

                        through these F lines and writes in the lower margin below 'if by a man

                        exit'. Compare D'Avenant: 'If by a Man it be thy Fate to Die. /
                        [<em>They Fight</em>, Macbeth <em>falls. They shout within. / /
                           Macd</em>. This for . . . I'le as a Trophy bear / Away his Sword, to

                        The added lines in PB have been crossed through, but again presumably by
                        the nineteenth-century exhibitor. The action in PB is not entirely
                        clear. The F s.d. at 34 '<em>Exeunt fighting. Alarums. / Enter fighting,
                           and Macbeth slain</em>.' has been left untouched, but the added
                        lines in PB seem to rule out any exit and make it clear that Macbeth is
                        slain on stage immediately after fighting with Macduff, who then exits,
                        as in D'Avenant. It is surprising that PB retains the business of
                        Macbeth's head, in view of D'Avenant's more decorous substitution of his
                        sword, followed by both Bell and Lee. Since Macbeth's body apparently
                        remains on stage (a difficulty also with the F text), one must suppose
                        that Macduff exits with the head at 34. Bell, Lee give Macbeth an
                        eight-line dying speech (described by Gentleman as "furnished by Mr.
                        <em>Garrick</em>, to give the actor more eclat"; though he admits
                        that "from the desperate state of Macbeth's mind, we think his immediate
                        death most natural."); the speech begins with two lines suggested by
                        D'Avenant's line ''Tis done! the scene
                         of life will quickly close. /
                        Ambition's vain, delusive dreams are fled,'.

                        The lines have been deleted in probably three stages. First, 38-53 (' .
                        . . him.') were partly circled and crisscrossed by Hand III; second
                        36-37 seem to have been circled and the last half of 53 crossed through
                        by Hand IV; third, 35 was included in the cut with 36-37 by Hand IV
                        (perhaps the third stage was actually a part of the second). The
                        original arrangement (Hand III's) gave Malcolm and Siward
                        three-and-a-half lines before Macduff's entry at 53; the final
                        arrangement (Hand IV's) brings Macduff on directly after Malcolm,
                        Siward, Ross, etc. D'Avenant reduces the F lines to seven; Bell, Lee
                        retain F essentially unchanged.
