               <h1> Smock Alley <br><em>The Merry Wives <br>of Windsor</em>
                  <br>Third Folio <br>Introduction 
               </h1>
               <p>IN the absence of any actors' names in the Smock Alley prompt-book
                  (PB) of <em>The Merry Wives of Windsor</em>, the presence of
                  which can sometimes date a prompt-book within certain limits,
                  what evidence there is for dating depends upon (1) handwriting
                  links in the prompt notations with other Smock Alley prompt-books
                  and (2) the probability that Francis Baker, -who was associated
                  with Smock Alley from about 1670 to 1685 and who acted Falstaff
                  in <em>I</em> and <em>2 Henry IV</em>, also acted Sir John in
                  <em>Merry Wives</em>.<a href="#n1" class="super">[1]</a>
                  
               </p>
               <p> Three hands can be distinguished in the <em>Wives</em> PB. Hand I,
                  which appears also in the Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em> (Hand III;
                  c. 1676-79), <em>Macbeth</em> (Hand IV; c.1774-82)
                  <em>Othello</em> (Hand VI; c. 1677-78or 1682-83), the
                  Smock Alley acting list for <em>Julius Caesar</em> (before
                  1676),<a href="#n2" class="super">[2]</a> and perhaps as the main
                  prompt-hand in 
                   John Wilson's
                  <em>Belphagor</em> (probably 1677-78), a Smock Alley
                  manuscript prompt-book now in the Folger Shakespeare Library (MS.
                  V.b.109), is responsible for the prompt notations: scene
                  settings, except probably two (I.ii and III.i), act and property
                  notations, sound effects, advance character calls, added stage
                  directions, resulting from the Third Folio's (F) use of "massed
                  entries,"<a href="#n3" class="super">[3]</a> almost certainly all
                  textual cuts, textual changes, and a single four-word addition
                  (I.iv.28). It is thus the only significant prompt-hand in the
                  <em>Wives</em> PB. Hand II is the same intrusive
                  eighteenth-century hand that appears in <em>King Lear</em> (Hand
                  III), <em>Hamlet</em> (Hand IV), <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em>
                  (Hand II), and <em>Twelfth Night</em> (Hand II). Hand II emends
                  the Folio text, at least for this play, by reference to a copy of
                  Thomas Hanmer's edition of Shakespeare (Vol. I, 1744), a text
                  that incorporates emended readings from Rowe, Pope, Theobald, and
                  Hanmer himself. Two readings appear to be original with Hand II
                  (see <em>Textual changes</em>, II.ii.142; V.V.107).<a href="#n4" class="super">[4]</a> There is no reason to suppose that
                  Hand II's alterations have any connection with Smock Alley or
                  with the theatre. Hand III is found only in those pages
                  transcribed from a copy of F2 (1632) prepared to replace two
                  leaves of the <em>Wives</em> Third Folio text (sigs. E3 and E4;
                  pages 53-56; III.v.89-IV.v.4), leaves that had somehow been lost
                  or seriously defaced. The same hand, a large,
                  professional-looking Italian script, appears again as the main
                  scribal hand in the Smock Alley prompt-book of Wilson's
                  <em>Belphagor</em> (see note 3) and in the Smock Alley
                  <em>Hamlet</em> (Hand VI). Hand III's fifteen manuscript
                  pages retain the Folio massed entries (see note 4) and contain no
                  prompt notations, suggesting that the <em>Wives PB</em> was never
                  used after the additional leaves were inserted. This would in
                  turn seem to suggest that Hand III made his transcription only
                  shortly before or after 1685, the year in which Baker, Smock
                  Alley's Falstaff, left Smock Alley to join the United Company 
                   in London, where,
                  ironically, there is no record that he ever performed the
                  role.<a href="#n5" class="super">[5]</a>
                  
               </p>
               <p> If, then, we accept the probability that Baker played Falstaff in
                  the Smock Alley productions of <em>Merry Wives</em> and that the
                  <em>Henry IV</em> plays, in which we know he played
                  Falstaff and which can be dated after 1675 and before 1685, were
                  more likely to have been produced before <em>Merry Wives</em> at
                  Smock Alley (as <em>I Henry IV</em> had been in London),<a href="#n6" class="super">[6]</a> we may at least postulate date
                  limits for the <em>Wives</em> PB as falling roughly within these
                  same limits, though probably performed somewhat later than the
                  first productions of <em>I</em> and <em>2 Henry IV</em>. These
                  suggested limits receive support from the dating of other Smock
                  Alley prompt-books that share Hands I and III with the
                  <em>Wives</em> PB and, as shown above, range in date from
                  about 1674 to 1683. 
               </p>
               <p> The <em>Wives</em> PB is very lightly cut, only about fifty-two
                  lines (including half-lines) being deleted, by circling, almost
                  certainly by Hand I (compare his method of adjusting the F massed
                  entries). Only Fenton's role is significantly cut (thirty-two
                  lines), two cuts (II.i.52-53, 81-82) may represent some slight
                  attempt at bowdlerizing, and all reference to the Garter ceremony
                  (V.v. 67-77) has been omitted. Neither Hand I nor Hand III,
                  however, makes any attempt to modernize syntax or substitute
                  familiar for "hard" words, as happens in most of the other Smock
                  Alley prompt-books. 
               </p>
               <p> W. S. Clark tells us that <em>"The Merry Wives</em> and <em>Twelfth
                     Night</em> were as little cut for Dublin as for London
                  performances."<a href="#n7" class="super">[7]</a> If this was,
                  indeed, true of London performances, it would help to explain why
                  the Smock Alley <em>Merry Wives</em> (and <em>Twelfth Night</em>,
                  only about ten lines) was so lightly cut, but I know of no
                  evidence to substantiate such a statement. Certainly, later
                  theatre texts are much more heavily cut (e.g., [1] as acted 
                   at Drury Lane, in John
                  Bell's <em>Shakespeare's Plays, As they are now performed at the
                     Theatres Royal in London</em>, Vol. III, 1773; [2] as
                  revised by John Philip Kemble and acted at Covent Garden,
                  1804).<a href="#n8" class="super">[8]</a> Both Bell and Kemble
                  omit IV.i and IV.vi (Kemble also omits V.i) and cut other scenes
                  quite considerably (see <em>Textual cuts</em> for further
                  details). The <em>Wives</em> PB has been compared throughout with
                  the above two theatre texts and, where possible, with John Dennis
                  <em>The Comical Gallant; or The Amours of Sir John
                     Falstaffe</em> (1702), an extensively reworked adaptation
                  of <em>The Merry Wives</em>. Also compared are the Folger MS of
                  <em>Merry Wives</em><a href="#n9" class="super">[9]</a> and the
                  so-called Collier MS (the Perkins Folio [1632], now in the
                  Huntington Library), which contains no textual cuts.

               <p> Four of the scene settings ('Town', 'Tauern', 'Chamber', 'The
                  Groue') may be considered as stock, appearing in other Smock
                  Alley Shakespeare productions,<a href="#n10" class="super">[10]</a> but
                  four other settings are found only in the <em>Wives</em> PB:
                  'Clouset' (I.ii,), 'Worst Chamber' (canceled and replaced by
                  'Tauern', I. iii), 'Chamber without ye Bed' (I.iv), and 'Great
                  forres :' (V.iii). See <em>Scene settings</em>.

                     Hand III) makes use of Charles Jennens' edition of <em>Lear</em>
                     ( 1770), he probably did not begin fiddling with these plays in
                     the Smock Alley Third Folio (1663/64) until after 1770. One of
                     Hand II's readings (see <em>Textual changes</em>, V.v.107) is
                     found elsewhere only in the Collier MS, and perhaps a second (see
                     <em>Advance character calls</em>, I.iv. 93, 112), though
                     also found in Kemble, should be included in the same category. On
                     the possibility that Collier may have known and used the Smock
                     Alley folio, see Introduction to the Lear PB, note 5.

                     limits from 1670-85 to 1675-85 because Joseph Trefusis who plays
                     the 1. Carrier in <em>I Henry IV</em>, only began acting at Smock
                     Alley about 1675 (see Clark, <em>Irish Stage</em>, pp. 77, 208).
                     <em>Pericles</em> (season of 1659-60), <em>Othello</em>,
                     <em>I Henry IV</em>, <em>Merry Wives</em>, <em>Hamlet</em>

                     the Restoration (<em>The London Stage</em>, pp. 7, cxxix).
                     Although <em>2 Henry IV</em>, like <em>I Henry IV</em>, was
                     assigned to the King's Company in 1668-69, it does not seem to
                     have been acted in London during the Restoration (see <em>The
                        London Stage</em>, Index). For once Smock Alley struck out
                     independently in matters Shakespearean.

                     <p>All the scene notations, except probably two (I.ii;
                        III.i), are made by Hand I, who, uniquely in the
                        Smock Alley Shakespeare prompt-books, includes, in
                        addition to a notation at the beginning of acts or
                        scenes, an advance call (except for I.i; I.ii;
                        II.i; V.i) anticipating the notation to follow
                        (e.g., II.i.213-216 'Tauern / Redy' followed by
                        'Tauern' at the beginning of II.ii). The closest
                        analogy is the use of 'scean' as an advance call
                        signaling a change of scene in the Smock Alley
                        <em>Hamlet</em> (see Vol. IV in this series). As
                        shown by the contrasting lightness or darkness of
                        the ink, the advance scene notations appear to have
                        been added after the advance character calls were
                        inserted. No scene notations are marked in the MS

                     <p>These two categories, ordinarily separate, have been
                        combined because the F text of <em>Merry Wives</em>
                        employs "massed entries" (see below), making it
                        difficult to discuss one without the other. Hand I
                        is responsible for the 
                         character
                        calls, all of them advance calls. There are no
                        advance calls for characters entering at the
                        beginning of an act, but the following scenes in
                        each act (except V.v) have advance calls for
                        characters entering at the beginning of a scene, as
                        well as for characters entering at later points in
                        a scene. In <em>Merry Wives</em> Hand I's task was
                        more than usually complicated because the printed
                        text that serves as the basis for the Smock Alley
                        PB (i.e., F, like F1-2, 4) uses massed entries
                        (i.e., all characters who appear in a scene are
                        included, often in order of entry, in the opening
                        s.d. but without any indication of which characters
                        enter initially and which enter at some later point
                        in a scene). Hand I solved the problems posed by
                        the use of massed entries by circling all
                        characters not entering at the beginning of a
                        scene; he then marked the points of entry for the
                        other characters with 'Enter' and placed an advance
                        call for the characters involved in each
                        within-scene entry. Hand I's 'Enter' notations do
                        not repeat the names of the characters then
                        entering, the characters depending on the names
                        listed in the relevant advance call, Even less
                        specific, Hand I's use of 'Exett' or 'Exet'
                        ('Exeunt' is not used), being without the benefit
                        (as with 'Enter') of an advance call, fails to
                        specify whether another character exits with the
                        character whose exit is here indicated. Hand I
                        sometimes fails to mark entries and is even less
                        careful in marking exits, and when Ff2-4 insert an
                        occasional '<em>Enter</em>' or '<em>Exit /
                           Exeunt</em>' (rare except at the end of a scene),
                        Hand I depends on the F s.d. and adds no further
                        notation (except at III.i.74). Where a character is
                        sighted as about to enter, he or she is usually
                        brought on with 'Enter' at this point, a line or
                        two earlier than in edited and other theatre texts.

                         change was
                        presumably made to avoid confusion with Mr. Page;
                        edited and theatre texts convert to 'Robin'). Bell
                        begins I.iii with 39, thus omitting Bardolph from
                        the scene; Kemble delays the entry of Pistol, Nym,
                        and Robin until after 29 (cutting 30-38). <strong>93</strong> Robin is presumably included
                        with Falstaff in Hand I's 'Exet' following 29.
                        Bell, following Rowe, exits both at 95; Kemble,

                        that he will hide behind the arras in 97, so
                        presumably Hand I's 'Enter' after 143 means that he
                        just steps out from behind the arras; Kemble exits

                        for Caius' entry after 216, Hand I appears to
                        include three other names ( &lt;Ca&gt;ius / &lt;
                        &gt;on / &lt; &gt;e / &lt; &gt;s'); the first two
                        could be Fenton and Anne Page, though there is an
                        advance call for them at 187-188, but the fourth,
                        of which even the final 's' is uncertain, may be
                        '&lt;Evan&gt;s', although Evans is already on stage
                        at least since 136, or '&lt;Daun&gt;s', although
                        the only place a dance might later be executed
                        would be at the end of the play just before all the
                        characters make their final exit. <strong>223</strong> No exit marked for Caius (so Bell);
                        Kemble, following Capell, exits Caius.

                        Introduction, p. 42), "corrects" the F text some
                        thirty times, drawing almost entirely on
                        eighteenth-century edited texts from Rowe (1709) to
                        Hanmer (1744). Since there is no reason to suppose
                        that Hand II's changes are in any way connected
                        with theatrical performance, only those readings
                        that are apparently original with Hand II, a few
                        readings that are questionably Hand II's (possibly
                        Hand I's), and readings where either Bell or
                        Kemble, singly, disagrees with Hand I, are included

                        see Introduction, p.42. Hand III contributes
                        occasional verbal variants and omits two lines
                        (IV.iv.26-27). The lemmata for Hand III's variants
