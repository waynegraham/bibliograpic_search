               <h1>Introduction<br>
                  <em>The Winter's Tale</em>: Padua<br> First Folio
               </h1>
               <p>THE association of the prompt-book of <em>The Winter's Tale</em> with the Padua
                  <em>Macbeth</em> and <em>Measure for Measure,</em> aside from the fact that it is part of the
                  same University of Padua First Folio, rests on the initials `T S.' found three times in this
                  prompt-book and once in <em>Macbeth</em>. In <em>Macbeth</em> `T S' plays the role of the
                  Doctor in IV.iii; in <em>Winter's Tale</em> he plays a Servant in III.ii and V.i and apparently
                  a 'Lord' in V.i. 178 (though it is possible that his second appearance in V.i is as a Servant
                  again). In the General Introduction I identified `T S' as a certain `Tho: Slender' who had
                  performed in Sir Edward Dering's private production of <em>The Spanish Curate</em> about 1624,
                  and on the basis of these initials and other similar evidence I suggested further that the
                  Padua prompt-books should be assigned to Sir Edward Dering and his group of amateurs.<a href="#n1" class="super">[1]</a>
                  
               </p>
               <p>The prompt-hand that is common to the Padua <em>Macbeth</em> and <em>Measure for Measure</em>
                  does not appear in <em>The Winter's Tale</em>. The prompt-hand in <em>The Winter's Tale</em>
                  (and I can detect only a single hand at work) is of a more markedly secretary cast than that in
                  the other two plays and its spelling forms are noticeably more archaic. Moreover, the owner of
                  this hand employs advance calls for his entering characters and some other anticipative
                  notations, a characteristic which at once distinguishes him from the reviser-prompter in the
                  other two  Padua prompt-books. This use of advance calls
                  would seem to suggest a later date for <em>The Winter's Tale</em> prompt-book, but, as I have
                  noticed in the General Introduction,<a href="#n2" class="super">[2]</a> such a system of advance calls
                  was coming into fashion around 1625-31 and might well be found in a prompt-book contemporary
                  with ones still using the older system. One particular prompt-notation also suggests a
                  pre-Restoration date: the prompter's addition of the direction `fflurrish' at five (probably
                  six) places in the text (all non-anticipative) where there is nothing in the Folio to suggest
                  such a direction.<a href="#n3" class="super">[3]</a> So far as I know, Restoration prompters rarely
                  used the term `flourish'; where they noted such calls they more generally employed some form
                  like 'Trumpet sounds' (Smock Alley <em>Othello</em>, IV.i.225) or `So&lt;u&gt;nd here' (Smock
                  Alley <em>Hamlet</em>, I.iv.6), the sounding being prepared for by an advance call `Trumpet
                  ready'.<a href="#n4" class="super">[4]</a>
                  
               </p>
               <p>The Padua <em>Winter's Tale</em> was probably never completed for production. Although the
                  calls for characters are carried through the whole play, the cutting of the play stops with Act
                  I, Scene ii; a fate similar to that which later overtook the Smock Alley <em>Winter's
                     Tale</em>. Such a state of affairs, however, reverses the usual procedure, cutting (at least a
                  preliminary cutting) being ordinarily completed before the character calls or other
                  prompt-notations were inserted. Another unusual feature is the assignment to a particular actor
                  (`T S.') of two small roles at this very early stage in the preparation of the prompt-book. 
               </p>
               <p>The prompter is quite erratic in his use of advance calls for the characters, some calls
                  being thirty lines ahead, some as little as seven or eight lines. His `Act' calls are also
                  erratic, one  (for Act III) not being anticipative at all
                  (see the Collations). Apart from the character and act calls, with one exception, the notations
                  are non-anticipative. The exception is the advance call for the `Satire Dance' at
                  IV.iv.339-341, a call which is repeated at the point where the dance occurs. The prompter makes
                  no attempt to mark point of entry for his characters when they are called within a scene, and,
                  as usual, there are no calls for characters at the beginning of an act. In general, the
                  prompter deals accurately enough with the frequent massed entries found in the Folio text (see,
                  however, I.ii.204 and III.ii.4-6). 
               </p>
               <p>Because the Padua <em>Winter's Tale</em> prompt-book represents an unfinished cutting of the
                  play, one which could never have reached production, only two pages have been reproduced in
                  facsimile: sigs. [2B6]<em>v</em> (p. 300), 2C1<em>r</em> (p. 301). The
                  collation, however, records, as usual, all the prompt-calls, notations, etc. for the play as a
                  whole. 
               </p>
               <p>No full acting text of <em>The Winter's Tale</em> is available before Thomas Hull's Covent
                  Garden version which appeared in Bell's <em>Shakespeare</em>, Vol. V (1773).<a href="#n5" class="super">[5]</a> I have used this and J. P. Kemble's Drury Lane version (1802) for comparison with
                  the Padua prompt-book. I have also compared where possible the Smock Alley (unfinished)
                  prompt-book (c. 1670-85) and the cuts in the Collier-Perkins Second Folio.

                     Greene's <em>Looking Glasse for London and England</em>, which dates from c. 1625 (see C. R.
                     Baskerville, "A Prompt Copy of <em>A Looking Glass for London and England</em>," <em>MP</em>
                     [1932-33] XXX, 37-46). Like the Padua prompt-books, this propmt-book is a printed copy with
                     manuscript prompters' notations.

                     Dryden's <em>Tyrannic Love</em> (after 1672), perhaps belonging to the King's Company (see H.
                     H. Adams, "A Prompt Copy of Dryden's <em>Tyrannic Love</em>," <em>Studies in Bibliography</em>
                     [1951-52], IV, 170-174); and (b) in a single notation in the Smock Alley <em>Macbeth</em>
                     (before 1682) at I. iii. 135.

                     essentially with the Florizel-Perdita part only, although Garrick included the restoration of
                     Hermione (see C. B. Hogan, <em>Shakespeare in the Theatre, 1701-1800</em>, II [1957],

                        Camillo's comments in 213-214 and 215-216. The  failure
                        to delete Camillo's name reflects the prompter's regular handling of the F massed s.d's and
                        hence in itself tells us nothing; since the play begins with scene ii, there are no calls for

                         in the `<em>Officers</em>' of the F s.d with Leontes and
                        the Lords; PB, however, enters the `officer' (see below) with Hermione at 11. There is no
                        indication that scene i is omitted in PB; the lack of a call for Cleomenes and Dion is
                        regular at the beginning of an act. In this connection, however, we should note the failure
                        to place a call for Cleomenes and Dion in the next scene (see below, III.ii.4-6). Hull omits
                        the first scene; Kemble places it earlier, after II.ii.

                     <p>4-6 ([2A5]<em>v</em>) Hermione / officer] PB reads `officer' for the F

                        omission which points in the same direction as the single `officer': a desire to cut down the
                        number of extras. However, the Padua Macbeth and <em>Measure for Measure</em> tend to omit F
                        directions for `Attendants', etc. who have no speaking parts. PB also omits any call for
                        Cleomenes and Dion later in the scene, a direction likewise, of course, omitted in F which
                        here uses a massed entry s.d.

                        course, would give an easy reading and was used for pounds sterling, but the last letter is
                        clearly a `d'). It is a curious coincidence that `ld:' could mean `Lord' and that `Lord' is
                        the missing role-title connected with `T S.' (see the reproduction of this page).

                        direction in F. Although this notation, like the one at V.i.233, is placed at the end of the
                        scene, it obviously has reference to the opening of scene iii. Kemble begins scene iii with
                        <em>Trumpets sound</em>.'.

                        non-anticipative. Both Hull and Kemble include a call for music here.

                     <p>155 ([2C2]<em>r</em>) Between the rules which divide the last line of the play
                        and `The Names of the Actors', PB has the notation `fflurrihell' which looks like a
                        portmanteau of `fflurrish' and `fflorizell'. It is, I think, an error for `fflurrish' (though
                        there is no indication of a `flourish' in F), although the unlikely possibility remains that
                        it is a garbled call for Florizel to speak some kind of epilogue.
