            <h1> Smock Alley <br><em>The Comedy of Errors</em>
               <br>Third Folio <br> Introduction 
            </h1>
            <p>THE Smock Alley <em>Comedy of Errors</em>, like the Smock Alley <em>Midsummer Night's
                  Dream</em> and <em>The Winter's Tale</em>, strictly considered, is not a prompt-book. It
               contains no scene settings, actors' names, advance character calls, calls for stage properties
               or sound effects, and act notations.<a href="#n1" class="super">[1]</a> What it offers is a text of
               the play as it appears in the Third Folio (1663/ 64) fairly heavily cut for acting, possibly,
               as R. C. Bald has suggested, to be presented as an afterpiece.<a href="#n2" class="super">[2]</a>
               
            </p>
            <p>If we accept Bald's suggestion, the <em>Errors</em> PB should most probably be dated sometime
               after 1700, since before that date afterpieces were rarely included as part of an evening at
               the theatre.<a href="#n3" class="super">[3]</a> Though considerably cut the <em>Errors</em> PB is
               still somewhat 
                too long (about 1,215 lines) for the average
               afterpiece,<a href="#n4" class="super">[4]</a> and such external and internal evidence as the
               prompt-book affords, admittedly slender, suggests that it was probably prepared at Smock Alley
               sometime before 1700. It was, we know, part of the same copy of the Third Folio in which the
               seventeenth-century Smock Alley prompt-books were prepared before that volume was finally
               broken up by Halliwell-Phillipps around the middle of the nineteenth century.<a href="#n5" class="super">[5]</a> This common provenience, though suggestive, proves nothing, of course, so far as
               dating is concerned. Internal evidence in the <em>Errors</em> PB depends entirely on an
               analysis of the revising hands responsible for the cutting. 
            </p>
            <p>The <em>Errors</em> PB contains one main revising hand (Hand I). Hand I is responsible, I
               believe, for most of the cutting, a few changes in the Folio stage directions, all but possibly
               three of the linking bits of added dialogue, and probably the greater number of the single word
               substitutions. So far as I am able to judge, Hand I occurs nowhere else in the Smock Alley
               prompt-books and so offers no relatively datable link with other Smock Alley prompt-hands. What
               appears to be a second hand (Hand II) is found most clearly in a number of 'stet' notations
               (see I.i.99-109; III.i.86-106; III.ii.33-40; V.i.52-54, 58, 61), notations that are noticeably
               and consistently different from Hand I's 'stet' notations.<a href="#n6" class="super">[6]</a> Besides
               restoring some of Hand I's cuts, Hand II is probably responsible for some of the single word
               substitutions and perhaps for three of the linking tags (see I.i.65-78, 88-95; III.i.108-114).
               Hand II may be the same as Hand II in the Smock Alley <em>Henry VIII</em> (see 'stet' at
               I.iv.37-38; II.ii.97-107; II.iv.38), a hand that also appears in the Smock Alley <em>Lear</em>
               (Hand II) and perhaps as Hand V in the Smock Alley <em>Hamlet</em>. 
                Whether, however, Hand II's work as a whole, apart from
               the use of 'stet', in <em>Errors</em> and <em>Henry VIII</em>, is indeed by the same hand, it
               is, I think, nearly certain that at least the 'stet' notations, associated above with Hand II
               in both plays, are by the same hand, in themselves representing possibly a third hand common to
               both prompt-books. This 'stet' link, then, between <em>Errors</em> and <em>Henry VIII</em>,
               since the <em>Henry VIII</em> PB can be dated as not later than 1682,<a href="#n7" class="super">[7]</a> suggests (though does not prove) a seventeenth-century provenience for the Smock
               Alley <em>Errors</em>. 
            </p>
            <p>Already the shortest of Shakespeare's plays (1,753 lines),<a href="#n8" class="super">[8]</a> the
               Third Folio text of <em>Errors</em> has been cut by about 538 lines (a figure including
               half-lines), leaving a play of about 1,215 lines. The principal cuts (of 10 lines or more) are:
               I.i.65-78; II.i.8-42, 88-111; II.ii.26-40, 65-111, 32-148, 172-182; III.i.87- 97; III.ii.45-58,
               159-169; IV.iii.16-35; V.i.75-84, 92-108, 138-154, 231-253, 397-406. Adriana's role is
               proportionately the most heavily cut, and the character of Balthazar has been omitted, his
               lines, when uncut, being spoken by Angelo. In addition to his omission of Balthazar, Hand I
               makes two other, apparently quite senseless, rearrangements. The first occurs in III.ii, where
               Hand I decides to make Antipholus of Syracuse exit with Luciana at line 70, thus clearing the
               stage.<a href="#n9" class="super">[9]</a> He then begins a new scene and, following line 70, brings
               Dromio of Syracuse and Antipholus of Ephesus on together, these two carrying on the dialogue
               describing Luce the kitchen maid through line 151, at which point, realizing that only
               Antipholus of Syracuse could take part in the following exchange with Dromio of Syracuse, he
               exits Antipholus of Ephesus, after a new two-line speech (only partly legible), and enters
               Antipholus of Syracuse. As a result of this rearrangement, Dromio of Syracuse's farcically
               exaggerated description of Luce loses all point when addressed to Antipholus of Ephesus, who,
               as her master, must already know her. The second alteration is much slighter but equally
               difficult to understand. Near the end of V.i, at line 414, the first two lines of Dromio of
               Syracuse's speech are assigned, again by Hand I, to Dromio of Ephesus, and the third line (416)
               is reassigned to Dromio of Syracuse. So far as I can see, this 
                redistribution of the dialogue makes nonsense, and I can
               only suppose that here (as in III.ii) Hand I has fallen victim to his own comedy of errors. 
            </p>
            <p>The confused nature of Hand I's alterations and the absence of the other stigmata
               characteristic of a prompt-book make it clear, of course, that the Smock Alley <em>Errors</em>
               could never have served as a prompt-book unlike the probably somewhat earlier 'Nursery'
               <em>Errors</em>, which was produced not later than 1677.<a href="#n10" class="super">[10]</a> Had the
               Smock Alley <em>Errors</em> been produced, however, it would probably have been very similar to
               the version that emerged under Hands I and II (with Hand I's unhappy alterations ironed out).
               Together the 'Nursery' PB and the Smock Alley <em>Errors</em> extend our knowledge of the
               acting tradition by nearly a hundred years, the first post-Restoration performance of the play
               of which we possess an acting text being Thomas Hull's adaptation (acted 1762, privately
               printed 1770, revised edition 1793).<a href="#n11" class="super">[11]</a>
               
            </p>
            <p>The cuts and other changes in the Smock Alley <em>Errors</em> PB have been compared
               throughout (see Collations) with: (1) the 'Nursery' <em>Comedy of Errors</em> PB (not later
               than 1677; about 1,375 lines), (2) Thomas Hull's 1793 revised adaptation of <em>The Comedy of
                  Errors</em> (about 1,544 lines); (3) <em>The Comedy of Errors</em> (about 1,565 lines), edited
               by Francis Gentleman in Vol. VIII, 1774, of John Bell's <em>Shakespeare's Plays, As they were
                  performed at the Theatres Royal in London</em> (Gentleman only suggests cuts but claims no
               authority for them as representing performance at either Drury Lane or Covent Garden); (4)
               <em>The Comedy of Errors</em> in Mrs. Inchbald's <em>British Theatre</em>, Vol. I (1808),
               essentially Hull's adaptation (see Collations); (5) John Philip Kemble's acting text (1815) of
               <em>The Comedy of Errors</em> (essentially the same as Inchbald; see Collations). Occasional
               reference is made to the Douai MS of <em>The Comedy of Errors</em> (l694);<a href="#n12" class="super">[12]</a> the so-called Collier MS; and William Woods' <em>The Twins, or Which Is
                  Which</em> (1780; see note 4). 
            </p>
            <div class="note" id="n1">
               <p> 1. The Smock Alley <em>Errors</em> will be referred to by the abbreviation PB. It
                  is worth noting, perhaps, that the Smock Alley <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, though only an
                  unacted cutting like the <em>Errors</em> PB, includes scene settings (see Vol. VII of this
                  series). It is possible, therefore, that the absence of scene settings in <em>Errors</em>
                  reflects the revisers' intention to use a single setting for the whole play (see Introduction
                  to the Smock Alley <em>Henry VIII</em> PB, p. 19). Capell first introduced a single setting
                  ('Ephesus. <em>A publick Place</em>.') and is followed by Gentleman (see below); Hull,
                  Inchbald, and Kemble (see below) introduce a number of scene changes, following Pope.

                  entitled <em>The Twins, or Which Is Which</em> by William Woods and acted at Edinburgh in 1780,
                  Woods himself playing the role of Antipholus of Ephesus (the text was published in John Bell's
                  <em>British Theatre</em>, Vol. XV, 1780, pp. 1-21). <em>Errors</em> is there cut to under 800

                  form of 'stet' (lower case 's', italic 'e', both 't's crossed) and appears very similar to the
                  form used by Hand I in the Smock Alley <em>Henry VIII</em> PB (see II.iv.64-68, 69). Since,
                  however, apart from 'Stet', Hand I in <em>Errors</em> is markedly different from Hand I in
                  <em>Henry VIII</em> and since there is good reason for believing that 'Stet' is the work of
                  the otherwise different Hand I in each play, this particular form of 'Stet' furnishes no link
                  between <em>Errors</em> and <em>Henry VIII</em>.

                  <em>Every Body Mistaken</em> (1716) and <em>See If You Like It</em> (1734), were never

               <p>Since the Smock Alley PB of <em>The Comedy of Errors</em> contains no scene settings (like
                  the 'Nursery' PB; see Vol. III of this series), actors' names, advance character calls, calls
                  for stage properties or sound effects, and act notations, the following collations have been
                  divided into only two categories: <em>F stage directions altered; new stage directions
                     added</em> and <em>Textual cuts and textual changes</em> (the second category combining what
                  are usually treated as separate categories because the principal <em>textual changes</em> are
                  immediately related to <em>textual cuts</em>.

                      stage; in canceling the direction at 128 ('<em>Enter .

                     for Luciana, who speaks at 129 ('<em>Lucio</em>' is a mistake in F2-4 for

                     86 (perhaps 86-88) and 98-100, these lines being restored in each case by 'stet' at left of
                     center rule, the two 'stet's (i.e., 'Stet' and 'stet'), however, being in different hands,
                     the first by Hand I, the second by Hand II. Originally only parts of this speech seem to have
                     been cut: 89-91 and 94-97 being separately boxed and crisscrossed, 101-102 being crossed
                     through, with a line drawn between 100 and 101. Hand II writes 'stet' six times down the left
                     margin, in each case opposite a separately marked group of lines, a move intended to reverse
                     the complete cutting of the passage, which had been indicated by boxing lines and a large,
                     heavy crisscross. Hand II's 'stet's, however, have been crossed through for 89-91 and 94-97,
                     and all the 'stet's canceled by a vertical line drawn through them. Four stages may,
                     therefore, be postulated: partial cutting, complete cutting, complete 
                      restoration, and a second partial cutting. NPB cuts
                     89-91, 98-106; Hull gives 85-93 to Balthazar, the remainder of the speech to Angelo;
                     Inchbald, Kemble (as partially in PB) assign 85-106 to Angelo but break the speech after 93
                     by inserting the last four lines of Hull's addition (see 65-68). <a class="fragment" data-toggle="com31108" href="images/com31108.jpg">108-114

                     Boxed (so NPB). <strong>198 She whom . . . wife;]</strong> Crossed through (NPB cuts
                     198-200). <strong>20l-202 Even in . . . me.]</strong> Crossed through (see 198 for NPB;
                     Hull+ cut 201-202). <strong>215-217 Neither disturb'd . . . mad.]</strong> Circled and
                     crisscrossed (NPB cuts 210, 215-216,229 ['. . . not.'], 237 [<em>'Pinch . . .'</em>]-238,
                     240-241, 244; Gentleman suggests cutting 224-253; Hull+ cut 214-253, 256-268, 281). <strong>219-221 were he . . . then,]</strong> Crossed through; Hand ?I substitutes, across
                     right rule, 'can 
                      wittness / it.'; F 'Who' in 222 appears to have been
                     crossed through but is necessary to the sense. A dash is inserted in PB following the end of
                     218 and 222; whatever the intention, these dashes cannot, in terms of sense, mark a suggested
                     cut. See 215-217. <strong>231-253 I did . . . indignities.]</strong> Boxed and doubly
                     crisscrossed (see 215-217). <strong>302-306</strong>
                     <em>Fat. Dromio</em>, nor . . . him.] Boxed (so Hull+). <strong>311-318 Though now .
                        . . <em>Antipholis</em>.]</strong> Boxed and crossed across (Hull+ cut 316). <strong>341-345 Speak old . . . AEmilia.]</strong> Crisscrossed, but marked 'Stet' by Hand I. <strong>352-353</strong> from them, . . . <em>Epidamium</em>.] Crossed through by Hand ?I,
                     who substitutes 'away' as a link to 354. <strong>355 I, to . . . in.]</strong> Crossed
                     through. <strong>367-368</strong>
                     <em>E. Ant.</em> Brought to . . . Uncle.] Crisscrossed (Hull+ read 'Minaphon' for F
                     '<em>Menaphon</em>').<strong> 391-392</strong>
                     <em>Cur.</em> Sir, I . . . cheer.] Crisscrossed (so Hull+, which do a good deal of
                     rearranging and padding from 346 to the end). <strong>397-406 That by . . .
                        Nativity.]</strong> Boxed; 397-398 crisscrossed, 399-406 crossed across (Hull+ cut 400-402).<strong>414</strong>

                     416 below). Hull+ cut everything after 407, adding 9 new lines, which conclude with '
                     "Whatever is is right." ' <strong>416 She now]</strong> S: She now <em>Hand I</em> (the
                     change of speech-prefix here and at 414 above makes no sense; see Introduction, p. 75)
