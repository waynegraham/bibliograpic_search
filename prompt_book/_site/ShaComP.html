            <h1>Introduction<br> The Comedy of Errors<br> First Folio 
            </h1>
            <p>THIS prompt-book of <em>The Comedy of Errors</em> is, I believe, the only
               surviving Restoration prompt-book of a Shakespearean play which can be
               connected, though perhaps only indirectly, with the London theatre.<a href="#n1" class="super">1</a> The evidence for provenience is unusually full and at
               the same time teasingly inconclusive. Working from the prompter's calls it is
               possible to construct the following complete cast for the play: <a href="#n2" class="super">2</a></p>
            <ul>
               <li> Antipholus of Ephesus: Mr. Biggs </li>
               <li> Antipholus of Syracuse: Mr. Disney </li>
               <li> Dromio of Ephesus: J. Coish </li>
               <li> Dromio of Syracuse: J. Wall </li>
               <li> Aegeon: Mr. James </li>
               <li> Duke of Ephesus: Wm. Wall </li>
               <li> Gaoler: Wm. Wall </li>
               <li> Officer: Wm. Wall </li>
               <li> Angelo: Mr. Wingfield </li>
               <li> Merchant: Tady (<em>or</em> Taddy) 
               </li>
               <li> Pinch: Tady (<em>or</em> Taddy) 
               </li>
               <li> Adriana: Mrs. Coish </li>
               <li> Luciana: Mrs. Cook </li>
               <li>Lady Abbess: Mrs. Wall </li>
               <li> Courtezan: Mrs. Chocke </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Two definite points emerge from a study of this cast: it contains the names of no
               major actors or actresses;<a href="#n3" class="super"> 3</a> and those names (John
               Coysh, Thomas Disney, Mrs. Sarah Cooke and Mrs. Wall) which can be identified
               with known theatrical performers in the Restoration are, with the exception of
               Mrs. Wall, all associated with Thomas Killigrew's King's Company. <a href="#n4" class="super">4</a> Reference to Genest and Nicoll shows that Coysh,
               spelled 'Cash', <a href="#n5" class="super">5</a> played one of the roles in Thomas
               Duffett's <em>Spanish Rogue</em>, produced about March of 1672/3,<a href="#n6" class="super">6</a> and Genest remarks that "from the names of the
               performers it seems probable that it came out at a nursery for the King's
               Company." Of the actors named, however, only two (Cash and Powell) <a href="#n7" class="super">7</a> were not established
                members of the King's Company since at least
               1669 and the title-page of <em>The Spanish Rogue</em> asserts that the play was
               performed by "His Majesties Players." Coysh also appeared in Nathaniel Lee's
               <em>Nero</em> at Drury Lane in May, 1674, and continued to play minor roles
               with the company down to 1681. Coysh is linked with Mrs. Sarah Cooke in John
               Leanerd's <em>The Country Innocence</em>, presented about March 1676/7 at Drury
               Lane, and with Thomas Disney and Mrs. Cooke in Leanerd's <em>Rambling
                  Justice</em>, presented about March 1677/8 also at Drury Lane. He also
               appeared in William Chamberlayne's <em>Wits Led by the Nose</em>, produced at
               Drury Lane about July 1677. I have singled out these three last plays because,
               apart from the fact that Coysh is here associated with Disney and Mrs. Cooke,
               Genest, as in the case of <em>The Spanish Rogue</em>, links two of them
               (<em>Rambling Justice</em> and <em>Wits Led</em>) with the Nursery and the
               other (<em>Country Innocence</em>) with what he calls "the younger part of the
               Company." The seeming contradiction here has been dealt with by P. H. Gray in a
               useful article called "Lenten Casts and the Nursery: Evidence for the Dating of
               Certain Restoration Plays." <a href="#n8" class="super">8</a> He argues that a Nursery
               provenience for these (and other) plays is a mistake arising from a confusion on
               Genest's part between the "younger part of the Company" and the Nursery (of
               which Genest mistakenly thought there were two at this period, one for each
               company); that, in fact, none of these plays was acted at or by the Nursery but
               at the Theatre Royal <a href="#n9" class="super">9</a> by the younger or hireling
               members, as distinguished from the share-holding members, of the King's Company.
               Gray bases his argument on the assumption that the actors at the Nursery were
               all young, inexperienced, apprentice actors. This I think is a questionable
               assumption. Unfortunately we know almost nothing of the actual personnel of the
               Nursery, but of neither Joseph Haines nor John Coysh who joined the Nursery
               ranks around 1667 can it be said that they were exactly inexperienced
                apprentices. <a href="#n10" class="super">10</a> It
               is possible, I think, that Dryden's well-known lines in <em>Mac Flecknoe</em>
               have somewhat biased our view of the Nursery and that, indeed, a Nursery company
               was a widely assorted one, including seasoned actors and every other
                gradation down to the apprentice. But the
               objection I have raised does not seriously vitiate Gray's arguments so far as
               the particular plays which he considers are concerned.
            </p>
            <p>Apart from Coysh, Disney, and Mrs. Cooke, the only other player in <em>The Comedy
                  of Errors</em> cast whom I have been able to trace is Mrs. Wall. She appears
               as a member of the cast in the Smock Alley prompt-book (MS) of John Wilson's
               <em>Belphegor</em>, the production of which has been dated either about 1677
               or 1682-83.<a href="#n11" class="super">11</a> It is also possible that Mrs. Chocke
               should be identified as the mother of the precocious 'Miss Denny Chock' who, in
               1696, at the age of six, spoke a smutty epilogue at Drury Lane.
            </p>
            <p>The problem in the case of <em>The Comedy of Errors</em> is considerably
               complicated by the absence of any exact date around which to work. Authorities
               seem to agree that Coysh, Disney, and Mrs. Cooke were younger members of the
               King's Company by 1677 (Coysh by 1673), but Coysh at least (and we have no
               record of either Disney or Sarah Cooke before 1677) was, as we have already
               observed, at the Nursery in Hatton Garden with Captain Bedford around 1667. It
               would also seem highly probable that both Disney and Mrs. Cooke were at the
               Nursery before 1677 Thus the apparent Nursery connection throws some question on
               a King's Company (Theatre Royal) provenience. Moreover, in no other cast
               preserved for the Lenten or other vacation performances allowed to the "younger
               members" of the King's Company (and the same statement may be made for the
               Duke's Company) are there anything like the number of noncenames. As we have
               seen, of the twelve individuals named in <em>The Comdy of Errors</em> cast only
               three appear in the records of the King's Company or, with one exception
                elsewhere. For this reason alone the Nursery
               provenience seems more likely than one which supposes such a large number of
               otherwise totally unknown actors and actresses among even the hireling ranks of
               the King's Company.
            </p>
            <p>A combined performance between three younger members of the King's Company and
               recruits from the Nursery is, of course, another possibility, either as a Lenten
               or vacation play at the Theatre Royal, or as a Nursery production "glamourized"
               by the addition of King's Company actors. But such a supposition seems on the
               whole unlikely.
            </p>
            <p>A third different, though related, provenience remains to be considered. In
               August, 1672, John Coysh, presumably with allowance from George Jolly, then
               patentee of the Nursery, led a troupe of players to Norwich. <a href="#n12" class="super">12</a> Unfortunately no details of the personnel of the troupe have
               survived, but in all probability it was composed of members of the regular
               Nursery Company, for it seems to be generally agreed that Nursery companies
               (probably under the title of the Duke of Monmouth's Men) toured in the
               provinces. From 1673-1681 Coysh seems to have been a regular, if minor, member
               of the King's Company, <a href="#n13" class="super">13</a> and does not appear again
               connected with provincial touring until 1683. Since both Thomas Disney and Sarah
               Cooke were regular members of the King's Company by 1677,<a href="#n14" class="super">14</a> the 1672 Norwich tour would give a date when all three might well
               still be members of the Nursery and willing to undergo provincial touring
               conditions. It may also be noted that the fourth identifiable name in <em>The
                  Comedy of Errors</em> cast, Mrs. Wall, also fits into a possible 1672
               Norwich performance.
            </p>
            <p>Setting aside the unlikely possibility of a King's Company provenience for the
               prompt-book, all the evidence points to a date at least before 1677 and probably
               earlier than 1673. The absence of Haynes from the cast may possibly indicate a
               date after 1667.
            </p>
            <p>On the evidence so far advanced I have argued, fairly I believe, against a direct
               King's Company provenience for this prompt-book. But two pieces of evidence must
               still be considered which further link <em>The Comedy of Errors</em> and this
               particular prompt-book with Killigrew's company. First, <em>The Comedy of
                  Errors</em> (as well as <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em>) was among a group
               of plays assigned to Killigrew in 1667/8. This means that the acting rights in
               the-play belonged to the King's Company. Since, however, neither the
               <em>Errors</em> nor the <em>Dream</em> was later produced in the regular
               repertory of the King's Company, this fact does nothing more than underline the
               already established contacts with the King's Company and may even be interpreted
               to support a Nursery provenience. The second point seems at first sight rather
               more difficult to account for in terms of a Nursery (or Nursery-related)
               provenience: that is, Hand II in <em>The Comedy of Errors</em> (see below)
               appears also, I believe, as one of the principal prompt hands in the King's
               Company prompt-book of Shirley's <em>The Sisters</em>. The date of this
               production can be placed with certainty between 1668 and 1671. <em>The
                  Sisters</em> was acted by leading members of the King's Company, actors like
               Beeston, Cartwright, Haines, Mrs. Knepp, and Nell Gwyn appearing in the cast.
               Montague Summers in his study of <em>The Sisters</em> prompt-book assigns the
               prompter's marginalia to Charles Booth, who as Downes describes him was
               'sometime Book-keeper' at the Theatre Royal. <a href="#n15" class="super">15</a> The
               ascription may in part be right, but there seems to be no real evidence to
               support it. Moreover, there are at least two and probably three different hands
               at work in the prompt notations,  a
               complicating fact which Summers does not appear to consider. Exact
               identification of the hand common to the two prompt-books is not perhaps of
               immediate significance for the present study, though it might conceivably be
               suggestive. The important point is the appearance of this hand in a promptbook
               associated on almost every other count with either the Nursery or a Nursery
               touring company. It is possible that part of the answer to the difficulty lies
               in the disastrous fire which almost ruined the King's Company in January of
               1671/2, destroying part of the theatre, their costumes and scenery. Possibly in
               the period immediately following that fire Booth, or more likely another
               prompter formerly associated with Killigrew's men, found work with the Nursery
               and perhaps (since the dates fit in very neatly) accompanied Coysh's troupe to
               Norwich later in 1672.<a href="#n16" class="super">16</a></p>
            <p>At this point the argument has been carried as far as our very fragmentary
               knowledge of the Nursery and provincial companies will allow. The case against
               considering this promptbook as one belonging to the King's Company proper seems
               to me strong. To distinguish between the claims of the Nursery and those of a
               provincial Nursery touring company (most probably at Norwich) is much more
               difficult and in this instance not of great importance since the actors and the
               acting version would be essentially the same in both.
            </p>
            <p>Two hands may be distinguished in the prompt notations. Hand I, an early type of
               secretary hand, is responsible for textual changes and cutting and occurs again
               in the 'Nursery' cutting of <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em>. Hand II, a fairly
               consistent Italian hand (with occasional secretary <em>e</em>'s) is associated
               with the calls for the characters (regularly by actor's name) and
                with stage business. This hand appears also
               in the King's Company prompt-book of Shirley's <em>The Sisters</em>, where again
               characters are usually called by actors' names.
            </p>
            <p>The prompt-book was prepared in a copy of the First Folio. Unfortunately, at some
               stage in its history, probably before it was divided from the rest of the volume
               and bound separately, the last page of the text (sig. I2) was lost. The missing
               page has been restored from another copy of the First Folio -- with small
               comfort to us! <a href="#n17" class="super">17</a> It is quite possible that this final
               page contained a license from the Master of the Revels or his deputy, <a href="#n18" class="super">18</a> a license which might have settled the whole problem
               of provenience immediately.
            </p>
            <p>The absence of any indications of scene-settings in this prompt-book is unusual
               for the Restoration, though significantly, perhaps, the same lack of settings is
               found in the Smock Alley prompt-book of <em>The Comedy of Errors</em>. Their
               absence in the Smock Alley version may be explained, perhaps, by the fact that
               the play never seems to have reached production. <a href="#n19" class="super">19</a>
               But this explanation will not serve for the 'Nursery' prompt-book. Probably the
               answer lies in the nature of <em>The Comedy of Errors</em> itself, since the
               play requires almost nothing in the way of formal settings. Bell's text (1774),
               for example, edited by Francis Gentleman, gives a single setting for the whole
               play ('<em>A public Place</em>').<a href="#n20" class="super">20</a> Where one set
               served for the whole play no indication of the set used would necessarily appear
               in the prompt-book. I advance a similar argument to explain the absence of
               scenes in the Smock Alley <em>Henry VIII</em> prompt-book,
                but, so far as I know, there is no actual
               evidence of Restoration practice in such a case.
            </p>
            <p>Apart from the absence of scenes, <em>The Comedy of Errors</em> bears the
               characteristic marks of Restoration prompt-books: 'Act Ready' placed a number of
               lines before the conclusion of each act (except the last, which, though missing,
               would not presumably call for the 'Act'); 'Ring' at the end of each act for the
               inter-act music; and points of entry marked with the usual diagonal crossed
               line. The prompter's habit of using actors' names instead of the usual character
               names in his calls has already been noticed. He also at times, most often at the
               beginning of an act where no advance calls had been entered, writes in the
               actor's name above or below the character name in the Folio stage direction.
               This characteristic appears in various other Restoration prompt-books, but only
               very sporadically within any single prompt-book. <a href="#n21" class="super">21</a></p>
            <p>A total of 378 lines has been cut by the reviser (probably Hand 1).<a href="#n22" class="super">22</a> This leaves a play of approximately 1,375 lines.
               <a href="#n23" class="super">23</a> The cutting here is somewhat lighter than that
               in the Smock Alley version, where the play is reduced to around 1,208 lines. In
               discussing the Smock Alley version, Professor Bald suggests that it was being
               prepared as an after-piece. This is possible, but the difference in length
               between these and the later eighteenth-century acting versions which were not
               played as after-pieces is so comparatively slight that it does not seem very
               likely. <a href="#n24" class="super">24</a> On the whole the cutting in the 'Nursery'
               version is aimed at reducing the number of lines in the long speeches,
               particularly that of Aegeon in I.i. The parts of Adriana and Luciana have also
                been quite heavily cut throughout, as also
               that of the Abbess in the last scene. Apart from these the only major cut comes
               in II.ii.67-110 -- a passage of tiresome nonsense between Antipholus and Dromio
               of Syracuse. The character of Luce has been either intentionally dropped or
               confused with that of Luciana; at any rate Luce's lines in III.i are spoken by
               Mrs. Cooke who plays the role of Luciana.

            <p>An important aspect of this prompt-book, and one which helps to explain the
               amount of cutting, is the number of songs and dances which both Hand I and Hand
               II have inserted throughout, usually at the beginning of a new scene. Three
               songs are called for and three dances (including 'Wingfields Jigg'). No
               indication of added songs or dances appears in the Smock Alley prompt-book.

                  problem of a possible relationship with the Mrs. James who was a regular member
                  of the King's Company from, at least, June of 1669. The problem is further
                  complicated by the slight uncertainty of the reading 'M<em>r</em>; it
                  is barely possible that we should read M<em>r</em>s.' (see the PB,
                  sig. I1<em>r</em>, p. 97). Apart from the difficulty posed by Mrs.
                  James' early association with the King's Company (see later discussion below),
                  the fact that the James who figures in <em>The Comedy of Errors</em> plays the
                  role of Aegeon makes it most unlikely that Mrs. James could be involved, though
                  admittedly not impossible (scarcely, however, a breeches role!) . Mr. James was
                  perhaps the husband of the King's Company actress, though it may be noted that
                  Montague Summers (<em>The Restoration Theatre</em>, 1934, p. 334) claims that
                  "About 1677 she was by force of Love Erept the Stage." I do not know his
                  authority (he is using Downes' well known words in <em>Roscius Anglicanus</em>
                  (1708), where, however, they are applied to three actresses of the Duke's
                  Company), but it is true that Mrs. James disappears from the casts of the King's
                  Company about 1677.

                  I wish it were possible to be more certain of this date. Haynes' biography is a
                  mass of conflicting statements. I suspect that Miss Rosenfeld bases the place of
                  meeting with Coysh on the statement in Tobyas Thomas' <em>The Life of the Late
                     Famous Comedian, Jo. Hayns</em> (1701), pp. 4-5, which recounts how, after
                  Haynes had taken his M.A. at Cambridge, he met 'Costa' and at Cosh's invitation
                  he "<em>Metamorphoses</em> his Cap and Gown to a Plum of Feathers, and a Persian
                  Robe; . . . After he had strowled thus about some Parts of the Country, he comes
                  to London; a timely arrival to Cap. <em>Bedford</em>, who at present was looking
                  for such sparks, as raising a Company of Actors, <em>Cosh</em> and
                  <em>Haynes</em> list themselves under the Captain, become his Principal Men,
                  whilst the Play House in <em>Hatton Garden</em> lasted, which this Captain
                  <em>Bedford</em> Built. But as everything has its Period in little time,
                  arrives the dissolution of this House, <em>Haynes</em> betakes himself to the
                  King's Play House in Drury-Lane, is entertain'd, at which time the Rehearsal
                  writ by his Grace the Duke of Buckingham, was to be Acted; . . ." Actually, of
                  course, Haynes went to Oxford, not Cambridge, where he entered Queen's College
                  and matriculated 3 May, 1659, although there is no record that he received any
                  degree (see <em>Alumni Oxonienses</em>, ed. Joseph Foster, 1891, II, 681; Wood
                  mistakenly [<em>Athenae Oxonienses</em>] gives the date as 1689). According to
                  Chetwood (<em>The British Theatre</em>, 1750, pp. 119-120), when Haynes was at
                  Queen's he came to the notice of Sir Joseph Williamson, who, when he became
                  Secretary of State, made Haynes his Latin Secretary. Haynes, however, could not
                  keep state secrets and Sir Joseph had to discharge him, giving him letters to
                  the "Heads of the University of <em>Cambridge</em>, where he was willingly
                  received; but a Company of Players coming to <em>Stourbridge</em> Fair, near
                  that place, Joe fell so much in Love with their Employment and Way of Living,
                  that he threw away his Cap and Band, and made one of their Company. He was soon
                  called to the King's Company in <em>Drury-Lane</em> . . . " (Baker,
                  <em>Biographia Dramatica</em>, 1812, Vol. I, Pt. I, 308, simply repeats
                  Chetwood's account). The connection with Sir Joseph Williamson is suggestive,
                  since Williamson was also a Queen's College man and (so the <em>D.N.B.</em>
                  tells us) a great friend to Queen's College men. Williamson, however, did not
                  become Secretary of State until 1674, long after Haynes was well launched on his
                  erratic dramatic career. It is possible, however, that Haynes became associated
                  with him in 1662 when Williamson became secretary to Sir Edward Nicholas.
                  Unfortunately, the Cambridge incident, as told by Chetwood, sounds rather like
                  an attempt to bring the story as told by Thomas into line with Haynes' Oxford
                  education. We do know, however, that the Nursery in Hatton Garden was built
                  probably during 1667 (Nicoll, I, 312) and that Haynes had joined the King's
                  Company by March 1667/8 (see Pepys' <em>Diary</em>, ed. H. B. Wheatley, 1896,
                  VII, 354-55). Since the schedule here outlined is pretty close, I would suggest
                  that perhaps 1666 would be a better date for the meeting of Coysh and
                  Haynes.

                     (1) the speech does not seem at all suitable to Angelo; (2) Angelo
                     (Wingfield) has been on stage since the beginning of the scene and
                     speaks at 123; (3) there is no call for Angelo's re-entry at 167. It is
                     possible, however, that the deletion of Angelo's speech at 128, in which
                     he says 'we will behold his death', may mean that he was supposed to
                     exit at this point and return at 167 in place of F's
                     '<em>Messenger</em>'; if this is so, the lack of a re-entry call is
