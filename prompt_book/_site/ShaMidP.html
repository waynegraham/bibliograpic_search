               <h1>Introduction<br> Smock Alley<br>
                  <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em><br> Third Folio 
               </h1>
               <p>UNLIKE the other Smock Alley prompt-books already published in this series
                  (<em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Macbeth</em>, <em>Othello</em>), the Smock Alley <em>A Midsummer
                     Night's Dream</em> (entitled 'A Midsummers nights DREAM' in the Third Folio, 1664 [F<em>3</em>]) is not properly speaking a full-fledged prompt-book. <a href="#n1" class="super">1</a> It shows no evidence of actual stage production, lacking the usual
                  advance calls for entering actors and act breaks or the occasional use of actors' names
                  for minor characters which turn up sporadically in most Smock Alley prompt-books. What we
                  have here, rather, is the first stage in the preparation of a potential
                  prompt-book—an extensive cutting of the play with unusually substantial revisions
                  and occasional additions. In contrast to the 'Nursery' <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em>
                  <a href="#n2" class="super">2</a> and the Smock Alley <em>Comedy of Errors</em> and <em>Winter's
                     Tale</em>,<a href="#n3" class="super">3</a> however, also cuttings that never reached
                  production, it does indicate scene settings throughout, except for IV.ii and V.i.
               </p>
               <p>The dating, even the approximate dating, of the Smock Alley revision of <em>A Midsummer
                     Night's Dream</em> and its relation to the  other
                  seventeenth-century Smock Alley prompt-books or revisions is complicated by several
                  factors. (1) Two revising hands may be readily distinguished: Hand I, responsible for
                  nearly all the revisions and the additions, and, presumably, for all the cutting; Hand II,
                  an intrusive mid-eighteenth-century hand, probably having no connection with the theatre,
                  which inserts occasional emendations first introduced by editors from Nicholas Rowe (1709)
                  through Thomas Hanmer (1744). <a href="#n4" class="super">4</a> But, since Hand I, like Hand I in
                  the Smock Alley <em>Comedy of Errors</em>, appears, so far as I can judge, nowhere else in
                  the Smock Alley prompt-books or revisions, the only certain link tying this revision of
                  <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em> to the Smock Alley copy of the Third Folio (before it
                  was broken up and dispersed by Halliwell-Phillipps in the nineteenth century)<a href="#n5" class="super">5</a> is the presence of Hand II, which also appears occasionally in
                  other Smock Alley plays (i.e., <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Lear</em>, <em>Twelfth Night</em>, and
                  <em>Merry Wives of Windsor</em>). <a href="#n6" class="super">6</a> (2) The absence of any
                  actors' names, often helpful in setting an approximate date for some of the Smock Alley
                  prompt-books,<a href="#n7" class="super">7</a> again isolates this revision from most of the
                  other Smock Alley materials. (3) The existence of a carefully prepared Smock Alley
                  revision of <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, even though it never reached the stage, is
                  in itself somewhat puzzling. The Smock Alley company tended to follow the lead of the
                  London theatres in its choice of plays, and the fact that London audiences evinced an
                  almost complete lack of interest in this play <a href="#n8" class="super">8</a> raises the
                  question why, or when, such a substantial and time-consuming revision was undertaken. Only
                  a single London performance of <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em> is recorded for the years
                  1660-1700, a performance by the King's Company (29 September 1662) that, except for "some
                  good dancing and some handsome women," greatly displeased Samuel Pepys ("the most insipid
                  ridiculous play that ever I saw in my life"). <a href="#n9" class="super">9</a> Indeed, no
                  version of <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em> comparable in length and comparative fidelity
                  to the Smock Alley revision was to be performed even in the eighteenth century. Thus,
                  except for the  1662 London performance, about which we
                  have no details aside from Pepys' acid comment, only selected bits and pieces of the play
                  (<em>The Merry Conceited Humours of Bottom the Weaver</em>, 1661; <a href="#n10" class="super">10</a>
                  <em>The Comick Masque of Pyramus and Thisbe</em>, 1716, by Richard Leveridge; and <em>The
                     Fairies</em>, 1755, by David Garrick) were performed until 1763, when Garrick and George
                  Colman produced a version that cut roughly half Shakespeare's text (including the whole of
                  Act V, except for lines 1-18) and was tricked out with 240 lines of non-Shakespearean song
                  lyrics, ten of them held over from The Fairies.<a href="#n11" class="super">11</a> It was an
                  immediate failure and was at once replaced by Colman's <em>A Fairy Tale</em> (1763), in
                  two short acts, based on the fairy characters and the 'rude mechanicals,' but again
                  without the Pyramus and Thisbe play.
               </p>
               <p>The Smock Alley revision, at least as we have it, cannot be earlier than 1664 since it
                  employs a copy of the Third Folio text. By that date the apparent failure of Shakespeare's
                  play on the London stage (September 1662) must surely have been known to the management of
                  Dublin's Smock Alley Theatre, which had opened its doors to the public in October of
                  1662.<a href="#n12" class="super">12</a> This, I think, makes a date in the 1660s at least
                  unlikely. W. S. Clark dates the Smock Alley revision, along with the other extant
                  seventeenth-century Smock Alley prompt-books, in the 1670s, <a href="#n13" class="super">13</a>
                  but at the time he wrote he was not aware that, like the Smock Alley <em>Comedy of
                     Errors</em> and <em>Winter's Tale</em>, it was only a preparatory revision and showed no
                  evidence of stage production or contemporary internal links with the other Smock Alley
                  plays.<a href="#n14" class="super">l4</a> Clark's 1670s dating cannot be ruled out,<a href="#n15" class="super">15</a> but there is  some, admittedly
                  slight and sporadic, evidence that may point to 1692 as a <em>terminus a quo</em> and
                  furnish a possible answer to the question raised in (3) above. The evidence for this date
                  grows out of what appear to be some verbal links between the revisions of Hand I and
                  <em>The Fairy-Queen. An Opera</em> produced at the Dorset Garden Theatre in May of 1692
                  with much fanfare and great expense.<a href="#n16" class="super">l6</a> As the title suggests,
                  the opera was based on Shakespeare's play, the text (published the same year) most
                  probably by Elkanah Settle, the incidental music by Henry Purcell. Shakespeare's lines are
                  heavily cut, many others substantially rewritten (see the Collations), and a strange
                  assortment of new characters, ranging from personified abstractions and pastoral figures
                  to Juno and Chinese with dancing monkeys, are introduced in four elaborately staged
                  extravaganzas of singing and dancing awkwardly inserted near the ends of Acts II through
                  V.
               </p>
               <p>As I have noted, these verbal links between Hand I's revisions and the text of <em>The
                     Fairy-Queen</em> are slight and sporadic. Of the twenty-seven possible links that I have
                  observed, only about fifteen suggest more than coincidence or a common desire to modernize
                  archaic forms. Among these fifteen, the following seem to me to be the strongest and will
                  serve to illustrate the kind and extent of the postulated connection. I.i.71, F<em>3</em>, 'For aye to be in shady Cloister mew'd,'; Hand I, 'Immurd For ever in
                  a shady Cloister.'; <em>Fairy-Queen</em>, 'To be immur'd for ever in a Cloister.'.
                  II.i.151, F<em>3</em>, 'Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath,'; Hand I,
                  'Uttering such sweet and such harmonious breath,'; <em>Fairy-Queen</em>, 'Sing with such
                  sweet, with such Harmonious breath,'. II.i.220-221, F<em>3</em>, 'Your virtue
                  is my priviledge: for that / It is not night when I do see your Face.'; Hand I, 'Your
                  virtue's my protection / w<em>th</em> me It is not night when I behold your
                  Face.'; <em>Fairy-Queen</em>, 'Your Virtue is my Guard, <em>Demetrius</em>: / It is not
                  night when I behold that Face,'. III.ii.377, F<em>3</em>, 'and all things shall
                  be peace.'; Hand I, 'and all shall be at peace.'; <em>Fairy-Queen</em>, 'and all shall be
                  at peace.'. III.ii.428, F<em>3</em>, 'Now go thy way: faintnesse
                   constraineth me,'; Hand I, 'but go thy way: faintnesse
                  now forces me,'; <em>Fairy-Queen</em>, 'My faintness forces me to rest a while,'.
                  IV.i.122-124, Hand I, marking 117-132 for omission, here inserts a new stage direction,
                  '&lt;S&gt;ong of / &lt;hu&gt;nting / &lt;h&gt;ere'; <em>Fairy-Queen</em> calls for '<em>A
                     Composition in imitation of Hunting</em>,' following line 143. IV.i.171-172, F<em>3</em>, 'Seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gaude,'; Hand I,
                  'Seems to me now, but the remembrance of an idle toy,'; <em>Fairy-Queen</em>, 'And now she
                  seems but as an idle Toy,'. IV.i.184, F<em>3</em>, '<em>Egæus</em>, I
                  will over-bear your will;'; Hand I, '<em>Egæus</em>, I must over-rule in this';
                  <em>Fairy-Queen</em>, '<em>Egæus</em>, I must over-rule your will;'. V.i.185, F<em>3</em>, 'No in truth sir, he should not.'; Hand I, 'No but he should not.
                  though'; <em>Fairy-Queen</em>, 'No, but he shou'd not.'
               </p>
               <p>Evidence of the kind just cited is notoriously difficult to evaluate. None of these
                  verbal links is beyond simple coincidence, but some small weight may, perhaps, be allowed
                  to the number of such links. One thing is clear. Even admitting the hypothesis of possible
                  influence, Hand I had at best only a vague recollection of the text of <em>The
                     Fairy-Queen</em>. Certainly there is nothing to suggest that he worked with an actual
                  copy, printed or manuscript, of Settle's opera. The case for influence is not strong. At
                  most, we must content ourselves, I think, with noting the Hand I-Settle links and allowing
                  for the possibility of some kind of interconnection. It is tempting, of course, to accept
                  Settle's influence, thus giving a date for the Smock Alley revision as 1692 or later and
                  suggesting an answer to the question of why the Smock Alley management suddenly became
                  interested in a revival of Shakespeare's play despite its earlier failure in London.
                  Tempting, but I am not fully convinced.
               </p>
               <p>One last point on dating. Hand I's use of a mixed Secretary-Italian script (unlike that
                  of Hand II) may probably be interpreted to indicate a seventeenth-century provenience for
                  the Smock Alley revision. He nearly always employs Secretary 'e', 'c', 'r', and 'd' and
                  occasionally Secretary 'h', 's', 'ff' (for upper case 'F'), and, once (V.i.208-215) a
                  tilde over 'o' for an '-ion' termination ('imaginatōn'). He also sometimes uses 'y
                  <em>e</em>' for 'the' (not a helpful indicator) and abbreviations like 'y<em>or</em>', 'O<em>r</em>', 'y<em>t</em>', 'y<em>n</em>', and 'w<em>th</em>'. The general use of Secretary forms
                  was on the wane after about 1650, and Hand I's fairly consistent adherence to them
                  suggests that he had been educated in the earlier part of the century when a mixed
                  Secretary-Italian hand was commonplace.
               </p>
               <p>Hand I's handling of the text shows him to have been an intelligent reviser. Although, in
                  an attempt to shorten an overlong play, he cuts quite substantially (in all about 600
                  lines, a figure that includes 34 half-lines, but does not include lines cut but replaced
                  by alternative lines),<a href="#n17" class="super">17</a> the play as a whole emerges basically
                  intact. Nothing comparable to the attempt to excise the role of Titania found in the
                  probably earlier 'Nursery' cutting of the play occurs here. <a href="#n18" class="super">18</a>
                  The low comedy scenes in which Bottom figures, including those with Titania, remain
                  essentially untouched, though some of the Court commentary on the Pyramus and Thisbe play
                  in V.i has been dropped. Of the some 96 cuts in other parts of the play, only 16 are of
                  ten lines or more: I.i.135-l49, 230-245; II.i.48-57, 88-111; II.ii.16-26, 41-65;
                  III.ii.64-87, 122-148 (retaining 136-137), 193-216, 220-235, 256-343; IV.i.53-68, 117-132;
                  V.i.7-22, 85-105, 402-422. As about half of these longer deletions indicate, Hand I's
                  cutting-edge falls most heavily (some 228 lines, which do not include numerous shorter
                  cuts in related passages) on the Helena / Hermia and Demetrius / Lysander love
                  entanglements and squabbles. These scenes admittedly lend themselves to substantial
                  cutting and suffered a somewhat similar fate in the adaptations by Settle, Garrick, and
                  Garrick-Colman. Only one of Hand I's cuts, Theseus' lines on 'The Lunatick, the Lover, and
                  the Poet' (V.i.7-22), would, I believe, outrage modern sensibilities, but even here we may
                  remind ourselves that some of these famous lines were probably an afterthought on
                  Shakespeare's part.
               </p>
               <p>In addition to marking passages for cutting, Hand I, more frequently than any other
                  reviser in the Smock Alley promptbooks, rewrites many lines and, particularly in some of
                  the more substantial cuts, substitutes one or more reworked lines, usually drawing their
                  wording at least in part from Shakespeare. Occasionally, he adds new dialogue of his own
                  and introduces stage directions to indicate stage business or action. In all these
                  respects, Hand I's attitude toward the text reflects, to be sure in a modified form,
                  rather the work of an adaptor, such as Dryden, Otway, Tate, or Settle, than the kinds of
                  revision usually associated with the ordinary theatre reviser.
               </p>
               <p>In most cases it is not difficult to understand why Hand I, like his contemporaries
                  generally, felt it necessary to meddle with 
                  Shakespeare's language. Although he only sporadically gets rid of comparatively archaic
                  forms ('does' for 'doth', 'has' for 'hath', 'ever' for 'aye', 'yes' for 'yea'
                  (consistently), 'hates' for 'hateth', 'you' for 'thou'), he has a sharp eye for 'hard' or
                  outmoded words or possibly difficult phrasing. Thus, for example, 'gaude' becomes 'knack'
                  and 'toy'; 'Belike', 'Perhaps'; 'Beteem', 'afford'; 'Steep', 'part'; 'gleek', 'be witty';
                  'misprision', 'mistake'; 'does square', 'contest'; 'coy', 'kiss'; 'wot', 'know';
                  'Recorder', 'flagolet' (first citation in <em>OED</em> 1659); 'abridgement', 'diversion'.
                  For similar reasons 'It stands as an Edict in Destiny' (I.i.151) is changed to 'Sure 'tis
                  y<em>e</em> inevitable law of fate'; 'passing fell and wrath' (II.i.20) to
                  'much incensd with'; 'Near this lack-love, this kill-curtesie' (II.ii.77) to 'near the man
                  / loves Enemy'; 'new in amity' (IV.i.92) to 'fresh agen in love'; 'in fancy followed me.'
                  (IV.i.168) to 'followed me. w<em>th</em> passion'; and 'with parted eye'
                  (IV.i.194) to 'scarce awake'.
               </p>
               <p>Three somewhat more substantial passages will illustrate Hand I's revisional technique
                  further:
               </p>Before the time I did <em>Lysander</em> see,Seem'd <em>Athens</em> like a Paradise to me.O then, what graces in my Love do dwell,That he hath turn'd a heaven into Hell?(F<em>3</em>, I.i.204-207)
               <p>Compare Hand I's neat couplet paraphrase:</p>for since I cannot w<em>th</em> Lysander be,at Athens, tis a perfect hell to meWhere <em>Demetrius</em>? oh how fit a wordIs that vile name, to perish on my sword?<em>Hel</em>. Do not say so <em>Lysander</em>, say not so:What though he love your <em>Hermia</em>? Lord, what though?Yet <em>Hermia</em> still loves you, then be content,(F<em>3</em>, II.ii.106-110)
               <p>Compare Hand I:</p>Where is <em>Demetrius</em>? y<em>t</em>disdainful L<em>d</em>tis iust y<em>t</em> he shoud perish by my sword?<em>Hel</em>. Now you're unkind <em>Lysander</em>, say not so:What though he love your <em>Hermia</em>? what though?while <em>Hermia</em> still is yours, be you content,Why should you think that I should wooe in scorn?Scorn and derision never comes in teares:Look when I vow I weep, and vowes so born,In their nativity all truth appears,(F<em>3</em>,III.ii.122-125)
               <p>Compare Hand I:</p>Why do you think I follow you in scorn?Scorn cannot well be masqud in sighs &amp; teares:See while I vow I weep, and vowes so born,like truth her selfe in her first dresse appeares
               <p>Here, as often elsewhere, Hand I is careful to preserve the original rhymes, and
                  sometimes he introduces new rhymes in order to retain the rhymed verse pattern (e.g.,see
                  (1) and (2) above end II.ii.77, 86, 88-89, 144; III.i.169; III.ii.372-373,409-410).
               </p>
               <p>Only rarely does Hand I venture his talents much beyond rephrasing Shakespeare's lines.
                  In a few places, however, he adds new dialogue and stage directions, emends, or calls for
                  extra stage business.<a href="#n19" class="super">19</a> Six of these additions are worth a brief
                  comment. (1) I.ii.109: Hand I uniquely calls for a dance by the 'rude mechanicals' by
                  inserting '&lt;bu&gt;t let us / &lt;reh&gt;earse Or / &lt;dan&gt;ce' at the end of
                  Quince's admonitory lines. (2) III.i.165s.d.-167: in a series of changes and deletions
                  (not necessary to repeat here; see Collations), Hand I gives Titania two new lines (the
                  first later deleted) and furnishes Bottom with an original aside:
               </p>Bot: I am afraid [<em>written above a deleted</em> Whoknows but] she may have a mind to ravish me whenshe has discoverd &lt;my&gt; parts why shoud I bea skittish nice Asse
               <p>(3) III.ii.256-343: replacing the longest of his cuts, Hand I concludes the scene with a
                  speech for Hermia of some seven or eight original lines, so badly shaved in binding that
                  they are unfortunately only fragmentarily legible (see Collations), except for a final
                  workman-like couplet:
               </p>&lt;?or&gt; in some / &lt;?plac&gt;e I may / &lt;for&gt;gotten fall/&lt;of a&gt;ll forsaken / &lt;?and fo&gt;rsaking all
               <p>(4) V.i.182 s.d.: Hand I here introduces new stage business when Pyramus says 'Curst be
                  thy stones for thus deceiving me.' by adding the stage direction '(kicks wall' and
                  underlines the action by altering Theseus' 'should curse again' (183) to 'should kick
                  again'. (5) V.i.220-221: Hand I here first attempts the emendation of a recognized crux.
                  In common with all seventeenth century texts, F<em>3</em> reads 'Here comes two
                  noble beasts, in a Man and a Lion.', which Hand I emends to 'Here comes two noble beasts,
                  a Man and a Lion. in one'. His reading, although it ignores Moonshine's entrance with
                  Lion, is not impossible. Several other emendations have been proposed (see the Cambridge
                  collations), but modern texts, surely correctly, read with Rowe (1714 ed.), who switched
                  the F comma to follow 'in'. And (6) V.i.260: following Lysander's 'Proceed Moon.', Hand I
                  inserts a new speech for Theseus, 'Duke. Calfe', a play on 'moon-calf' and suggested
                  perhaps by the term as applied five times to Caliban in Shakespeare's <em>The Tempest</em>
                  or, more probably, in the Davenant-Dryden-Shadwell adaptations of <em>The Tempest</em>
                  (1667, 1674).
               </p>
               <p>In setting up his act divisions, Hand I eventually accepted those as indicated in F<em>3</em>, except for Act IV, which he begins at III.ii.345, a change probably
                  made to avoid the awkwardness for Restoration staging of following the F direction
                  ('<em>They sleep all the Act</em>.'), which appears, in F<em>1-4</em>, at the
                  end of Act III, a direction he deletes, substituting 'Sleepers lie still'. Before arriving
                  at his final arrangement, however, Hand I had tried out beginning Act III at both III.i.
                  167 and at what in modern texts is distinguished as III.ii, and Act IV at III.ii.122
                  before he eventually settled for beginning it at III.ii.345.
               </p>
               <p>In addition to two scene settings that occur elsewhere in the Smock Alley prompt-books
                  ('Scen A Palace' I.i; 'Scen is y<em>e</em> fforrest' III.i; 'fforrest / Scen'
                  III.ii.344 s.d.; 'fforrest' IV.i and IV.i.107 s.d.),<a href="#n20" class="super">20</a> Hand I
                  calls for three scenes that appear only in <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em> ('Scen the
                  baudy house' I.ii; 'Scen is the New Grove' II.i, or 'Grove / agen' III.ii [the last
                  notation deleted]; 'Scene / is / The little / wood' II.ii.34 s.d.). No scene settings are
                  indicated for IV.ii and V.i. In the case of IV.ii, it seems likely that Hand I, like
                  Settle in <em>The Fairy-Queen</em>, thought of the reunion of Bottom with Quince and Co.
                  as taking place in the 'fforrest'; indeed, Theobald (1733) was the first editor
                   to mark a change of locale here. The failure to mark
                  a change of setting for V.i is more puzzling. One would expect 'Scen A Palace' as in I.i
                  (Bottom's 'meet presently at the Palace' was retained at IV.ii.37-38). Most probably Hand
                  I simply forgot to indicate a change of scene, but it is curious that Settle also fails to
                  call for a return to the Palace at his equivalent of V.i; and he too keeps Bottom's
                  direction at IV.ii.37-38, even though the 'rude mechanicals' were excluded from the final
                  scene and the Pyramus and Thisbe play had been transferred from Act V to follow III.i.82,
                  where Robin (Puck) is its only audience.
               </p>
               <p>For Acts II through IV, Hand I, unlike Settle, who, apart from his four specially
                  introduced scenic extravaganzas, satisfies himself with a single setting ('SCENE <em>a
                     Wood, by Moon-light</em>.', noted only at the beginning of Act II), envisages three
                  different settings. He places II.i in 'the New Grove', with a note ('Scen continues.')
                  preceding the entrance of Oberon and Titania at II.i.60. This setting is continued,
                  through the beginning of what is now generally considered II.ii, to II.ii.35, where, with
                  the entry of Lysander and Hermia, Hand I begins a new scene set in 'The little / wood',
                  which serves for the remainder of Act II. With the beginning of Act III, however, he
                  appears to have decided on a single setting ('y<em>e</em> fforrest' III.i;
                  'fforrest / Scen' III. ii.345; 'fforrest' IV.i and IV.i.107), although, when considering
                  beginning Act III at III.ii, he calls for 'Grove / agen' (deleted) and may have called for
                  the same scene when he made a second canceled attempt to begin Act III at III.i.167 (if so
                  the notation has been shaved away in binding).

               <p>The Smock Alley revision of <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em> has been compared
                  throughout with the following stage adaptations (see the Collations): (1) the 'Nursery'
                  revision (c.1672-78); <a href="#n21" class="super">21</a> (2) Elkanah Settle's <em>The
                     Fairy-Queen</em> (1692); (3) David Garrick's <em>The Fairies</em> (1755); (4) a revision
                  (now in the Folger Shakespeare Library) prepared in a copy of the 1734 Tonson edition by
                  David Garrick and George Colman; (5) David Garrick and George Colman's <em>A Midsummer
                     Night's Dream</em> (1763), based on (4) above; and (6) <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream in
                     Bell's Shakespeare's Plays</em>, Vol. VIII (1774), with notes and suggested cuts by
                  Francis Gentleman. The so-called Collier MS (in the Perkins-Collier Second Folio, 1632, in
                  the Huntington Library) and an adaptation of Shakespeare's play by Frederick Reynolds
                  (1816) are occasionally referred to.

                        Wits, or, Sport upon Sport</em> (1673). The title page of the 1661 edition claims that

                     back to performances of Shakespeare's original play by the King's Men in the earlier years

                        Dream</em> through a reference to it in S. W. Singer's <em>Text of Shakespeare vidicated
                        from the Interpolations and Corruptions advocated by John Payne Collier, Esq.</em>
                     (1853), a reference cited by R. C. Bald in "Shakespeare on the Stage in Restoration
                     Dublin" (<em>PMLA</em>, 56 [1941], 370); Bald, however, considers the Smock Alley version
                     to be lost. Alexander Cargill (<em>Shakespeare the Player</em>, 1916, Appendix D, p. 144)
                     had called attention to several Halliwell-Phillipps "old playhouse copies" in the
                     University of Edinburgh Library, but the <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em> he lists is
                     certainly the 'Nursery' cutting, not the Smock Alley revision. Neither Bald nor Clark
                     seems to have been aware of Cargill's note.

                        bracketings and crossing through, and substitutes '&amp; then' above F 'Moon:' (8),
                        with a caret after 'Moon'. 'This old Moon wanes?' (4) is not included in the

                        altered to 's'. The function of the cross placed after 5 is not clear; sometimes a
                        cross is used to mark a marginal insertion. Nursery PB cuts 13-19; <em>FQ</em>, 1-20;

                        replace canceled F speech-prefix at 7. As PB now stands, Hippolyta would seem to pick
                        up and repeat Hand I's addition to Theseus' speech at 3 above. Probably, however,
                        '&amp; then' in 3 was only intended as a cue to indicate where Hippolyta's speech
                        should begin. <em>FQ</em> omits the character of Hippolyta throughout.

                        rearranges these lines, with some changes and omissions, in two slightly different
                        ways. First, with a circled note at the end of 115, cued by a cross ('here bring / in
                        y<em>e</em> last 3 lines / &amp; y<em>n</em> go on w<em>th</em> / for you fair' [note circled and crisscrossed through]), he
                        reads: 'But <em>Demetrius</em> come, / And you [<em>for deleted</em> F
                        'come']<em>Egeus</em>, you shall along [<em>for deleted</em> F 'go'] with me, / I

                        <em>Hippolita</em>,'. Hand I's first version thus cuts 116 (bracketed and crossed
                        through), 122 ('what . . . Love?' bracketed and crossed through), 123 (crossed through
                        only), ('Against our nuptialls,' bracketed and crossed through), 127 (bracketed and
                        crossed through). The transposition of 120 and 121 is indicated by a small '2' and '1'
                        to the left of these lines, and the jump to 121 is cued by 'to death' (Hand I)
                        following 119. Hand I may originally have intended to retain
                         123 in place of 114 ('But . . ')-115, since it is
                        only crossed through, not bracketed; indeed, the crossing through may be entirely
                        associated with Hand I's second version. This second version, considerably shaved in
                        rebinding differs from the first only in some slight variations from the F text in
                        124-126. Crossing out both his note following 115 (see above) and lines 124-127 (127
                        being also bracketed, probably earlier for version one), Hand I writes in left margin
                        opposite 116-120: '&lt;I mus&gt;t imploy / &lt;you in&gt; som busines / &lt;of our&gt;

                        concerns / &lt;your s&gt;elves.' It is difficult to be sure of the word (or words)
                        following 'w<em>th</em> you', though clearly the full F reading ('Of
                        something, nearly') is too long to have been fitted into the available marginal
                        space.

                        remains undeleted in PB, which also retains F <em>'Enter Robin.'</em> at 780), his
                        confusion does not explain matters, since there is no exit given earlier

                        additions, the exact order of which is difficult to determine: (1) crossing through F
                        165 s.d. (<em>'Enter Peaseblossome . . . four Fairies.'</em>) and 166 (<em>'Fair.</em>
                        Ready: and I . . . we go?') and intending to begin Act III with Titania's speech
                        (166-177) (influenced by Titania's earlier 'therefore goe with me' [159] and the
                        omission in F<em>1-4</em> of 165 in which she summons Peaseblossom, Cobweb,
                        etc.), he inserts, following 164, 'Come follow me / my dear Exit:' (later crossed
                        through); (2) he adds, in bottom right margin below the deleted F 165 s.d. and 166,
                        'Bot: I am afraid [<em>the last three words inserted above a deleted</em> Who knows
                        but] she may have a / mind to ravish me when she has discoverd / &lt;my&gt; parts why
                        shoud I be a skittish nice Asse' (the last line shaved in binding and no exit
                        direction, if there once was one, visible); (3) he adds, in a bold hand, across the
                        top margin of the following F page (153), 'Actus 3<em>us</em>. Scen. 1<em>&lt;a&gt;</em> Titania &amp; Bottom, [<em>if anything followed</em>
                        'Bottom,' <em>it has been shaved away</em>] / Enter [<em>written over</em> 'Pease']
                        Peaseblossome, Cobweb, Moth, Mustardseed &amp; 4 fairies.' (the act-scene notation and
                        s.d. appear to have been crossed through; if a scene setting prefaced the act- scene
                        notation it has been shaved off); and (4) he adds, above 167, deleting the F
                        speech-prefix <em>'Tita.'</em> (167), 'Tit: You subject faires [<em>sic</em>] of /
                        y<em>e</em> noblest Race', and continues with F 167 ('Be kind . . .
                        Gentleman.). Note that Hand I makes another 
                        abandoned attempt to begin Act III at what in modern texts is III.ii (see III.ii
                        (opening)). Although Hand I eventually returned to the F Act III break, the additional
                        lines for Bottom and the second of the two added lines for Titania were apparently
                        retained, the shaving of the last line of Bottom's added speech leaving it unclear
                        whether it was originally intended to conclude the scene following Titania's added
                        'Exit:' (in which case it was probably followed by Hand I's own 'Exit:' now lost), or
                        whether it was intended to begin the new scene--more likely the former. In any case,
                        with Hand I's deletion of his new act-scene-entry notation, there is now no entry
                        given for Peaseblossom, etc. or the '<em>4</em> fairies', the F s.d. at 165
                        having been crossed through. None of the acting texts begins a new scene here;
                        <em>FQ</em> reduces Peaseblossom, etc. to <em>'Enter <em>4</em>
                           Fairies.'</em> (dropping all reference to them by name), adding 'Where are my Fairy
                        Spirits?' to Titania's shortened and rewritten F speech before their entry at 165; the
                        other acting texts that retain the scene (see III.i (opening)) treat Peaseblossom,
                        etc. as the quivalent of the F <em>'four Fairies'</em> (165 s.d.) (following Q<em>1-2</em>) and add 165 from Q<em>1-2</em> (first restored by
                        Theobald). Nursery PB cuts 108 s.d.-III.ii.40.

                        a large cross mark to the left (compare III.i.78 s.d.). Whether the projected change
                        here is earlier or later than that at III.i. 165 s.d.-167 is problematical. The scene
                        setting for III.i ('y<em>e</em> fforrest') presumably continues here after
                        the deletion of 'Grove / agen' above. Note that no change of scene setting seems to
                        have been called for when Hand I thought of beginning Act III at III.i.165 s.d.,
                        although that arrangement would also appear to call for a new setting. No new scene in

                        had inserted, following 256, 'Exeunt y<em>e</em> Men)', then deleted it,
