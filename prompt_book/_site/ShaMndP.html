            <h1>Introduction <br>
               <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>
               <br> First Folio 
            </h1>
            <p>THE 'Nursery' version of <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em> is not a prompt-book,
               but a simple cutting of the play.<a href="#mnd1" class="super">1</a> It contains no
               prompter's notations. It is possible, however, to link this cutting with the
               'Nursery' promptbook of <em>The Comedy of Errors</em> by the appearance in it of
               a common hand (Hand I in <em>Comedy of Errors</em>) and by the general method of
               marking cuts. It is, moreover, fairly certain that at one time the two
               separately bound volumes were parts of the same copy of the First Folio. <a href="#mnd2" class="super">2</a></p>
            <p>As the collations show there are almost no verbal alterations, but the hand in
               the three that do occur (see for example I.i.79), as I have noted, is the same
               as Hand I in <em>The Comedy of Errors</em>, and in both versions the cutting
               seems to be connected with this hand. It may also be observed that there is very
               little verbal alteration in <em>The Comedy of Errors</em>. Unfortunately
               everything from the end of act three (and a leaf containing parts of acts one
               and two) is missing, making it essentially impossible to say much about the
               cutting as a whole. Judging from what is left, however, the amount of deletion
               seems heavy: 511 lines in the first three acts, a figure which does not include
               what I suspect to be heavy cutting at the beginning of Act II
                and some probable cutting at the end of Act
               I.i. I should judge, therefore, a figure of 575 lines for the first three acts
               would be a fair estimate. With this we may compare the 460 lines cut in the
               first three acts of the Smock Alley prompt-book (in all, Smock Alley cuts around
               611 lines), in itself an example of rather heavy cutting. The Smock Alley
               version thus runs to roughly 1,491 lines; allowing for around 575, lines in the
               first three acts and about 170 for the last two (by analogy with Smock Alley),
               the 'Nursery' version will work out at about 1,357. <a href="#mnd3" class="super">3</a>
               
            </p>
            <p>The most interesting cut is the attempt to get rid entirely of the character of
               Titania or at least so much of her role as is concerned with the quarrel with
               Oberon over the little Indian boy and the consequent Bottom-enchantment episode.
               It is unfortunate that even in this case the loss of the leaf containing the end
               of Act I and the beginning of Act II makes the full extent of the cut somewhat
               conjectural. But it is certain, that lines 60-97 must have been deleted since
               they are entirely concerned with the Titania-Oberon quarrel, and almost
               certainly lines 19-31. In fact as the cutting now stands Oberon's first speech
               comes at line 245" just after the exits of Demetrius and Helena. In the
               prompt-book, however, there is a cross in the left margin opposite this speech.
               Since, in order to make the speech, Oberon must have entered at least fifteen to
               twenty lines (perhaps more) earlier, this cross cannot indicate his point of
               entry. In the Smock Alley prompt-books a cross is frequently used to mark the
               place of an insertion. Here, although no insertion
                was written in, there is an obvious need
               for some explanation of the "flower" referred to by Oberon in line 247,
               Shakespeare's earlier handling of the matter having been cut entirely. It may be
               noticed that this drastic cut also removes the Bottom-Asshead incident and would
               necessitate the later cutting of Bottom's dream (IV.i.203-23). As a result it is
               not clear what exactly is supposed to frighten the "hempen homespuns" at
               III.i.108. Presumably, however, Puck, although both his speeches have been cut,
               was meant to appear and scare them away; his entry has been preserved at line
               55. Such, at any rate, is the way ?Settle handles the situation in his operatic
               version of the play called <em>The Fairy Queen</em> (1692). Puck watches them
               perform the Pyramus and Thisbe parody (inserted here by ?Settle) and then
               without a word 'Robin <em>runs in amongst them</em>' and the mechanicals
               '<em>Exeunt, running several ways</em>!'.
            </p>
            <p>Since like the Padua <em>Winter's Tale</em>, the 'Nursery' <em>Midsummer Night's
                  Dream</em> is merely a cutting of the play which apparently never reached
               production, only two pages have been reproduced in facsimile: sigs. N1<em>v</em> (p 146) and N5<em>v</em> (p 154). The
               collation, however, records, as usual, all the cuts and notations for the whole
               play.
            </p>
            <p>The cutting of the 'Nursery' <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em> has been compared
               throughout with: (1) the Smock Alley prompt-book (almost certainly before 1700);
               (2) <em>The Fairy Queen</em> (1692), an operatic version frequently attributed
               to Elkanah Settle; (3) David Garrick's operatic version, <em>The Fairies</em>
               (1755)<a href="#mnd4" class="super">4</a>; (4) George Colman's and David Garrick's
               acting version (1763)<a href="#mnd5" class="super">5</a>; (5) Francis Gentleman's
               suggested cutting in Bell's <em>Shakespeare</em> (1774), vol. VIII.

                  the upper, outer corner of the leaves in both.

               <p>3. The eighteenth-century acting versions have been so drastically
                  shortened that comparative figures are not very helpful. Garrick's <em>The
                     Fairies</em> (1755) reduces the play to about 695 lines (of which 133 are
                  song lyrics) and omits the whole of the fifth act; the Colman-Garrick version
                  (1763) runs to about "364 lines (of which 189 are again song lyrics) and also
                  omits all but 18 lines of Act V. Francis Gentleman (Bell's <em>Shakespeare</em>,
                  1774, vol. VIII) marks only 176 lines for cutting, but the version he presents
                  (despite William Jaggard's entry [<em>Shakespeare Bibliography</em>, 191 l, p.
                  410]) makes no claim to be 'regulated' from the prompt-book of either house. In
                  a note at the end of Act I he adds; ". . . a little of the serious part might
                  perhaps be spared, but so small a portion, we have not marked the different
                  lines."

                  Hands of Garrick and Colman," <em>PMLA</em> (1939), LIV, 467-482). I have not
                  included George Colman's <em>A Fairy Tale</em> (1763) in the versions
                  examined.

                     is retained above at 55 but that he says nothing since his speeches here
                     and at go are cut. Garrick cuts III.i entirely and reports as part of
                     Puck's speech in III.ii.6-34 (reduced to 6 lines) how Titania has fallen
