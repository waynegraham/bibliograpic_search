        <head> Prefatory Note </head>
        <p>THE present volume, the eighth and last, essentially completes the series I began in
          1960, <hi>Shakespearean Prompt-Books of the Seventeenth Century</hi> . <note target="n1a">
            [1]</note> The format of this volume, however, differs substantially from that of the
          earlier volumes, a format designed to make it possible to include in a single volume the
          remaining six, hitherto unedited, Smock Alley prompt-books <hi>(King Lear, Henry VIII, The
            Merry Wives of Windsor, Twelfth Night, The Comedy of Errors,</hi> and <hi>The Winter's
            Tale)</hi> and a second prompt-book (Folger Second Folio) of <hi>Twelfth Night</hi> of
          unknown provenience. The reason for this change of format is simple enough: none of these
          seven prompt-books (with the exception of <hi>Henry VIII</hi> , in which the great
          majority of the prompt notations, however interesting, would be illegible if completely
          reproduced in facsimile) sheds sufficient new light on the special characteristics of
          Restoration prompt-books to warrant separate treatment of the kind accorded the Smock
          Alley <hi>Hamlet</hi> (Vol. IV), <hi>Macbeth</hi> (Vol. V), <hi>Othello</hi> (Vol. VI),
          and <hi>A Midsummer Night's Dream</hi> (Vol. VII), in which, in addition to a facsimile of
          the whole prompt-book (Part ii), a transcription of all prompt notations was included
          (Part i). Moreover, three of these prompt-books (<hi>The Comedy of Errors</hi> , although
          considerably adapted for substantial shortening, <hi>The Winter's Tale</hi> , and the
          Folger Second Folio <hi>Twelfth Night</hi> ) are only cuttings of the plays preliminary to
          the preparation of a functional prompt-book, a category into which the Smock Alley
            <hi>King Lear</hi> may also possibly fall. </p>
        <p> The format here adopted for each play arranges, where applicable, the prompt notations,
          not in <hi>seriatim</hi> order as in earlier volumes, but in nine categories: (1)<hi>
            Scene settings</hi> ; (2) <hi>Act notations</hi> ; (3) <hi>Actors named for <!-- </page> -->
            <!-- <page n=vi><ID>ShaLeaPvi</ID> --> comparatively minor roles </hi> (<hi>Henry
            VIII</hi> only); (4) <hi>Stage properties</hi> ; (5) <hi>Sound effects</hi> ; (6)
            <hi>Advance character calls</hi> (see below); (7) F (= Third Folio) <hi>stage directions
            altered; new stage directions added;</hi> (8) <hi>Textual cuts;</hi> (9) <hi>Textual
            changes</hi> . In only three respects, none of them except the third of significance, is
          the new format less complete than that followed in the earlier volumes: (1) advance
          character calls are generally not included in the collations, although any anomalies in
          such calls are noted and discussed under that heading; (2) the record of the "corrections"
          inserted in several of the Smock Alley prompt-books (here, <hi>Lear, Merry Wives, Twelfth
            Night</hi> ) by a late eighteenth-century hand, and derived for the most part from
          editions of Shakespeare's works (from Rowe [1709] through Jennens [1770]), is selective,
          since there is no evidence that associates this meddling hand with either Smock Alley or
          the theatre; (3) only one to three pages of each prompt-book are reproduced in facsimile,
          pages chosen to illustrate the one or more prompt-hands that worked on the various stages
          through which a prompt-book might pass. </p>
        <p> The seven prompt-books referred to above are now in the Folger Shakespeare Library,
          Washington D.C., and are here discussed, analyzed, and partially reproduced by the kind
          permission of the Trustees. </p>
        <p> My special thanks are more than due to Ruthe Battestin and Penelope F. Weiss of the
          Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia and to Gerald Trett, my press
          editor, who, uncomplainingly and charitably, turned an untidy and too often inconsistent
          manuscript into publishable form. </p>
        <p> Finally, I must thank my wife for her support and kind forbearance over this long
          eight-volume haul (1960-1996). G. B. E. </p>

        <note id="n1a"> 1. The Smock Alley prompt-books of <hi>I</hi> and <hi>2 Henry I V</hi> are
          not included in the series. Until comparatively recently they were known only through a
          fragment of <hi>I Henry IV</hi> in the Folger Shakespeare Library (see <hi>Shakespearean
            PromptBooks of the Seventeenth Century</hi> , Vol. I: Part i (1960), p. 20), but about
          1969 a considerable number of similar fragments of both plays (the butchery being the
          unholy work of Halliwell-Phillipps to whom these prompt-books at one time belonged) were
          discovered by Gunnar Sorelius in the Shakespeare Memorial Library in Stratford-upon-Avon;
          see his article "The Smock Alley Prompt-Books of <hi>I</hi> and <hi>II Henry IV</hi> ,"
            <hi>Shakespeare Quarterly</hi> , 22 (1971), 111- 128, in which these prompt-books are
          discussed in considerable detail. </note>

        <head> Smock Alley <lb/>King Lear <lb/>Third Folio <lb/>Introduction </head>
        <p>ALTHOUGH the Smock Alley provenience of this <hi>King Lear</hi> prompt-book (PB), based
          on a copy of the Third Folio (F) text, is proved by the appearance in it of two
          prompt-hands common to some other seventeenth-century Smock Alley prompt-books (see
          below), no exact dating limits, in the absence of any actors names among the prompt
          notations, can be suggested. There is, however, one peculiar feature of the <hi>Lear</hi>
          PB that makes it probable that the production for which it was prepared, though almost
          certainly before 1700, was after 1681, the year in which Nahum Tate's notorious but
          long-lived adaptation of Shakespeare's play was first acted and published.<note
            target="n1"> [1]</note> Tate, among other less radical "improvements," invented a love
          affair between Cordelia and Edgar (thus eliminating Cordelia's marriage to the French
          king), cut out the role of the Fool (not restored until 1838), and, in a "happy"
          denouement, turned the play from a tragedy into a kind of tragicomedy by allowing Lear,
          Cordelia, and Gloucester to remain alive: Lear and Gloucester, <!-- </page> -->
          <!-- <page n=2><ID>ShaLeaP2</ID> --> along with Kent, totter off to 'some cool Cell' to
          reflect on 'our Fortunes past, / Cheer'd with relation of the prosperous Reign / Of this
          celestial Pair [Cordelia and Edgar]'. The Smock Alley prompt-book shows no evidence,
          structural or verbal, of influence from Tate's version until the final scene (V.iii). At
          this point all advance character calls suddenly cease, the last such call being for Edgar
          and Gloucester (at V.i.54) in preparation for their entry at the beginning of V.ii. The
          cessation of advance calls at this particular point suggests, strongly, I think, despite a
          few cuts by Hand II in V.iii, that Hand I (see below) intended to conclude the play with a
          somewhat adapted version of Tate's "happy ending." Bizarre, even unlikely, as this may
          sound, it is, in fact, exactly what George Colman concocted (except for much heavier
          cutting, some occasional Tateification, and the omission of the Fool) in his alteration of
            <hi>Lear</hi> first performed in 1768, restoring Cordelia's marriage to the French king
          and omitting Tate's sentimental love business between Cordelia and Edgar.<note target="n2"
            > [2]</note>
        </p>
        <p> Three hands can clearly be distinguished in the Lear PB, two prompt-hands and a third
          intrusive late eighteenth-century hand. Hand I, which appears also in the Smock Alley
            <hi>Hamlet</hi> (Hands I and II)<note target="n3"> [3]</note>
          <hi>Macbeth</hi> (Hands I and II), <hi>Twelfth Night</hi> (Hand I), <hi>Henry VIII</hi>
          (Hand I), <hi>Othello</hi> (Hand II), and <hi>I Henry IV</hi> (Hand II), is responsible
          for the scene notations, the advance character calls and sound effects, and for the
          restoration of two cuts made by Hand II. Hand II, which appears also in the Smock Alley
            <hi>Henry VIII</hi> (Hand II) and perhaps in <hi>Hamlet</hi> (Hand V) initially (i.e.,
          before Hand I's work) went through the play circling lines, phrases, and single words for
          cutting, occasionally substituting new readings for words that struck him as archaic or
          "hard." Hand III, which also meddled in the Smock Alley <hi>Hamlet</hi> (Hand IV),
            <hi>Midsummer Night's Dream</hi> (Hand II), <hi>Twelfth Night</hi> (Hand II), and<hi>
            Merry Wives of Windsor</hi> (Hand II), inserts emended readings drawn from
          eighteenth-century editors from Rowe (1709) through Jennens (1770),<note target="n4">
            [4]</note> as well as a number <!-- </page> -->
          <!-- <page n=3><ID>ShaLeaP3</ID> --> of apparently original readings.<note target="n5">
            [5]</note> There is no reason to think that Hand III has any connection with the
          prompt-book's earlier Smock Alley provenience. Hand III's work disappears after II.iv.
          What may be a fourth hand (though possibly Hand I) may be responsible for the emended
          reading at III.i.22-25. </p>
        <p> The <hi>Lear</hi> PB is very lightly cut. Of the roughly 2,920 lines in the Folio text,
          Hand II marks for deletion only 123 lines and 40 half-lines (plus a few phrases and single
          words), and Hand I restores 11 of those lines, leaving a play (taking the 40 half-lines as
          equivalent to 20 lines) of roughly 2,777 lines,<note target="n6"> [6]</note> comparable in
          length to the Smock Alley <hi>Hamlet</hi> (2,806) and <hi>Othello</hi> (2,808), the later
          theatre texts of David Garrick (2,318; first acted 1756; first printed in John Bell's
            <hi>Shakespeare's Plays, As they are now performed at the Theatres Royal in London</hi>
          , Vol. II, 1773), George Colman (2,171; first acted and printed 1768), and John Philip
          Kemble (2,009; first acted and printed 1795, here consulted in Mrs. Inchbald's <hi>British
            Theatre</hi> , Vol. IV, 1808).<note target="n7"> [7]</note>
        </p>
        <p> Except for the postulated substitution of some form of Tate's "happy ending," discussed
          above, the Smock Alley <hi>Lear</hi> (discounting Hand III's much later meddling) shows no
          significant points of contact, verbally or in cutting, with either Tate's adaptation <!-- </page> -->
          <!-- <page n=4><ID>ShaLeaP4</ID> --> or the three acting texts referred to above, and they
          share with the prompt-book only a single scene setting (at IV.vii). All settings are stock
          and appear in other Smock Alley promptbooks.<note target="n8"> [8]</note>
        </p>
        <p> Certain characteristics of the <hi>Lear</hi> PB may perhaps suggest that, like the Smock
          Alley <hi>Midsummer Night's Dream, Comedy of Errors</hi> , and <hi>Winter's Tale</hi> , it
          was laid aside and never reached actual production: (1) the absence of actors' names among
          the prompt notes (contrast the Smock Alley <hi>Macbeth, Hamlet, Othello, Henry VIII,</hi>
          and <hi>I</hi> and <hi>2 Henry I V</hi> ); <note target="n9"> [9]</note> (2) the failure
          of Hand I (or some other hand) to insert advance warnings for a number of sound effects
          called for by the Folio stage directions (see <hi>Sound effects</hi> ); and (3) the
          absence of secondary cutting (contrast Smock Alley <hi>Macbeth, Hamlet,</hi> and
            <hi>Othello</hi> ).<note target="n10"> [10]</note> Although none of these points is
          necessarily conclusive against stage production, the second being the strongest, taken
          together they leave the final status of the <hi>Lear</hi> PB to some degree at least
          questionable. </p>
        <note id="n1"> 1. In any event, since only two London performances of Shakespeare's
            <hi>Lear</hi> , which was assigned to the Duke's Company in 1660, are recorded (1664/65
          and 1675) before Tate's 1681 adaptation and since Smock Alley tended to take its cue from
          London successes, it is probably unlikely that <hi>Lear</hi> would have been seriously
          considered for production before 1681. </note>
        <note id="n2"> 2. In 1823 Edmund Kean reversed Colman's arrangement and tacked Shakespeare's
          tragic denouement (V.iii) onto a text that was basically pure Tate, including the
          Cordelia-Edgar love affair. For Kean's acting text, see Cumberland's <hi>British
            Theatre</hi> , Vol. VI (1826). </note>
        <note id="n3"> 3. In Vol. VI: Part i, of this series, p. 4, note 19, I declared that the
          hands described as A and C (see the General Introduction, Vol. I: Part i, of this series,
          p. 17) were in fact a single hand. I have allowed this decision to stand, but I should
          warn the reader that I am no longer entirely convinced that Hands A and C should be
          treated as one. </note>
        <note id="n4"> 4. See Vol. I: Part i, of this series, pp. 15-16. I there described Hand III
          as mid-eighteenth century, but the <hi>Lear</hi> PB shows that Hand III worked on the
          Smock Alley prompt-books, or at least on this prompt-book, sometime after 1770, since he
          appears to make use of Charles Jennens' edition of <hi>Lear</hi> published in that year.
          Jennens was the first editor to publish a record of most of the Qq variants and the
          emendations of editors from Rowe through Johnson (Capell's similar record, though compiled
          earlier than Jennens', was not published until 1779). Five of Hand III's readings are
          peculiar to Hanmer's text, which was first published in 1743 (I.i.15, II.i. 94, 97, 111
          [not included in the collations], and II.i.70-74 [see <hi>Textual cuts</hi> ]), but Hand
          III may have picked them up from Jennens' textual notes. </note>
        <note id="n5"> 5. Three of Hand III's readings (II.i.96 [see <hi>Textual cuts</hi> ], 99
          [see <hi>Textual changes</hi> ], 125 [see <hi>Textual cuts</hi> ]) appear elsewhere only
          in the so-called Collier MS (see J. P. Collier's <hi>Notes and Emendations</hi> , 1852)
          and in Collier's 1853 edition (the third reading was later adopted by Alexander Schmidt,
          1879). Since the Collier MS (i.e., manuscript readings, supposedly contemporary, inserted
          in what is known as the Perkins Second Folio [1632] by Collier himself) is a
          mid-nineteenth-century forgery, it is tempting, though coincidence is barely possible, to
          suppose that Collier had had access to the Smock Alley Third Folio (1663/64) and purloined
          these three readings from the <hi>Lear</hi> PB. Collier may also have taken a hint from
          Hand III's reading at I.i.230 (see <hi>Textual changes</hi> ). </note>
        <note id="n6"> 6. My line-count is based on Alfred Hart's total (with allowance made for the
          Folio text) of 3,205 lines for Lear (see <hi>Review of English Studies</hi> , 8 [1932],
          21) The total of 2,777 for the Lear PB like the following totals for <hi>Hamlet,
            Othello</hi> , Tate's adaptation, and the three theatre versions, is, given the
          considerable amount of prose in these texts, necessarily somewhat of a rough estimate. </note>
        <note id="n7"> 7. See C. B. Hogan, <hi>Shakespeare in the Theatre 1701-1800</hi> , I (1952),
          44; II (1957), 333-335. </note>

        <note id="n10"> 10. In this connection, it should be noted that the Smock Alley <hi>Henry

          evidence of actual stage presentation, is without scene notations and omits some of the

              corner of F p. 784 has been torn off, leaving only final 'rs', which may be the
              remains of either 'drum / Colou&lt;rs&gt;' or 'souldie&lt;rs&gt;' (perhaps both were
              called for, Hand I including 'souldi&lt;ers&gt;' in the advance call at IV.vii); the
              advance call is in preparation for F s.d. at 17, '<hi>Enter with Drum &amp; Colours,
                Albany, Goneril, Souldiers</hi> .', but its position is anomalous, since it should
              have preceded (as at IV.ii.59-61 and IV.vii.48-49) the advance call for Albany and
              Goneril at the bottom of F p. 783 and may, therefore, have been inserted as an
              afterthought by some hand other than Hand I. </p>

          <p>Hand I is responsible for all the character calls, all of them advance calls except
            that for 'Kent / Glouster / Edm:' in I.i, where the call is placed in the left margin
            opposite 3-5. Hand I omits calls for '<hi>Attendants</hi> ' and '<hi>Servants</hi> '
            called for by F stage directions except at II.iv.128, where '(ser)uants' is included in
            the advance call at 95. Point of entry is not marked (as, for example, by a crossed
            horizontal line in the Smock Alley <hi>Othello</hi> and <hi>Twelfth Night</hi> ). An
            advance call for 'Knight' is inserted at I.iv.14, following an advance call for
            'stew(ard)' at 8 above. Since the Steward (i.e., Oswald) enters at 48 and, after a
            half-line, exits, and the Knight's first speech comes at 54, he is presumably meant to
            enter immediately after the Steward's exit. It is possible, however, that Hand I
            intended the advance call to mark the Knight's reentry at 5: (as in edited texts since
            Dyce, who exits him at 51), thus treating the Knight as being among the
              '<hi>Attendants</hi> ' called for in the F s.d. at 7. The missing advance call for
            Edgar to enter at V. .37 was probably on the torn-off left corner of F p. 784. There is
            no advance call anticipating the F s.d. at the opening of V.ii, which brings Lear and
            Cordelia's army '<hi>over the Stage, &amp; Exeunt.'</hi>, although there is an advance
            call for Edgar and Gloucester, who enter immediately after this F s.d., at V.i.54 (but
            no call for Edgar's reentry at V.ii.4). Advance calls cease with V.ii. For the probable
            implications of this lack of further advance calls by Hand I, see the Introduction, p.
            1. </p>

            <p>Both Hands II and III are responsible for a number of verbal changes in the F text.
              Of Hand II's comparatively few changes, all but one are unique to PB (see I.i.191) and
              are limited (except for the alteration of two speech-prefixes) to substituting
              commonplace words for words that by <!-- </page> -->
              <!-- <page n=13><ID>ShaLeaP13</ID> --> the closing decades of the seventeenth century
              were considered either archaic or "hard." Hand III, from I.i through II.iv, frequently
              emends the F text by inserting, usually with a caret, (1) corrections of F's obvious
              errors (some of these small corrections may, indeed, be the work of Hand II); (2) a
              few short phrases from the Qq (first introduced into the basic F1 text by Pope); (3)
              other editorial emendations derived from the editions of Rowe (1709) through Jennens
              (1770); (4) a few adjustments of lineation and punctuation, also derived from
              eighteenth-century editions; and (5) a sizable number of emendations that are unique
              to Hand III (in addition to two [I.i.230; II.i.99] shared only with the Collier MS;
              see also <hi>Textual cuts</hi>, II.i.96, 125). Since there is no evidence to suggest
              that Hand III's doctoring of the text has any connection with PB's Smock Alley
              provenience, only the readings in category (5), and a few of special interest in
              categories (3) and (4), have been included in the following collation. </p>
