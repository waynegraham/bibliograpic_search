         <h1> Smock Alley<br>
            <em>The Winter s Tale</em><br> Third Folio <br> Introduction 
         </h1>
         
         <p>THE Smock Alley <em>Winter's Tale</em> prompt-book (PB) is not, strictly considered, a
            prompt-book but a preliminary (and probably incomplete) cutting of the play, similar
            in this
            respect to the Padua <em>Winter's Tale.</em><a href="#n1">[1]</a> The method of cutting
            is noticeably like that in the Smock Alley <em>King Lear</em> PB, where it is associated with
            Hand II, who, as here, cuts by circling lines, phrases, and single words. Aside from
            the
            various cuts, no other prompt notations occur. 
         </p>
         
         <p> There is no record of any performance of <em>The Winter's Tale</em> during the Restoration,
            and the play was not produced in the eighteenth century until 1741-42 (fourteen performances).
            No further performances are recorded until 1754, at which time and in the years following
            the
            original play was replaced by three much shortened adaptations dealing primarily with
            the
            pastoral elements in Acts IV-V: <em>The Sheep-Shearing: Or, Florizel and Perdita</em> (1755),
            by MacNamara Morgan; <em>Florizel and Perdita, A Dramatic Pastoral</em> (1756), by David
            Garrick; <em>The Sheep Shearing</em> (1777), by George Colman. These and a somewhat shortened
            version of the original by Thomas Hull (1771) held 
             the boards for the remainder of the eighteenth
            century.<a href="#n2">[2]</a> A second version of the original was produced by John
            Philip Kemble at Drury Lane in 1802.<a href="#n3">[3]</a> Both Hull's and Kemble's
            acting texts have been compared with the Smock Alley promptbook; also compared are
            the Padua
            <em>Winter's Tale</em> PB and the so-called Collier MS.
