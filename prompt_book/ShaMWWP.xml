                            <p> Three hands can be distinguished in the <hi>Wives</hi> PB. Hand I,
                                   which appears also in the Smock Alley <hi>Hamlet</hi> (Hand III;
                                   c. 1676-79), <hi>Macbeth</hi> (Hand IV; c.1774-82)
                                          <hi>Othello</hi> (Hand VI; c. 1677-78or 1682-83), the
                                   Smock Alley acting list for <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> (before
                                          1676),<note target="n2">[2]</note> and perhaps as the main
                                   prompt-hand in <!-- </page> -->
                                   <!-- <page n=42><ID>ShaMWWP42</ID> --> John Wilson's

                                   manuscript prompt-book now in the Folger Shakespeare Library (MS.
                                   V.b.109), is responsible for the prompt notations: scene
                                   settings, except probably two (I.ii and III.i), act and property
                                   notations, sound effects, advance character calls, added stage
                                   directions, resulting from the Third Folio's (F) use of "massed
                                          entries,"<note target="n3">[3]</note> almost certainly all
                                   textual cuts, textual changes, and a single four-word addition
                                   (I.iv.28). It is thus the only significant prompt-hand in the
                                          <hi>Wives</hi> PB. Hand II is the same intrusive
                                   eighteenth-century hand that appears in <hi>King Lear</hi> (Hand
                                   III), <hi>Hamlet</hi> (Hand IV), <hi>Midsummer Night's Dream</hi>
                                   (Hand II), and <hi>Twelfth Night</hi> (Hand II). Hand II emends
                                   the Folio text, at least for this play, by reference to a copy of
                                   Thomas Hanmer's edition of Shakespeare (Vol. I, 1744), a text
                                   that incorporates emended readings from Rowe, Pope, Theobald, and
                                   Hanmer himself. Two readings appear to be original with Hand II
                                   (see <hi>Textual changes</hi>, II.ii.142; V.V.107).<note
                                          target="n4">[4]</note> There is no reason to suppose that
                                   Hand II's alterations have any connection with Smock Alley or
                                   with the theatre. Hand III is found only in those pages
                                   transcribed from a copy of F2 (1632) prepared to replace two
                                   leaves of the <hi>Wives</hi> Third Folio text (sigs. E3 and E4;
                                   pages 53-56; III.v.89-IV.v.4), leaves that had somehow been lost
                                   or seriously defaced. The same hand, a large,
                                   professional-looking Italian script, appears again as the main
                                   scribal hand in the Smock Alley prompt-book of Wilson's
                                          <hi>Belphagor</hi> (see note 3) and in the Smock Alley
                                          <hi>Hamlet</hi> (Hand VI). Hand III's fifteen manuscript
                                   pages retain the Folio massed entries (see note 4) and contain no
                                   prompt notations, suggesting that the <hi>Wives PB</hi> was never
                                   used after the additional leaves were inserted. This would in
                                   turn seem to suggest that Hand III made his transcription only
                                   shortly before or after 1685, the year in which Baker, Smock
                                   Alley's Falstaff, left Smock Alley to join the United Company <!-- </page> -->
                                   <!-- <page n=43><ID>ShaMWWP43</ID> --> in London, where,
                                   ironically, there is no record that he ever performed the
                                          role.<note target="n5">[5]</note>

                            <p> If, then, we accept the probability that Baker played Falstaff in
                                   the Smock Alley productions of <hi>Merry Wives</hi> and that the
                                          <hi>Henry IV</hi> plays, in which we know he played
                                   Falstaff and which can be dated after 1675 and before 1685, were
                                   more likely to have been produced before <hi>Merry Wives</hi> at
                                   Smock Alley (as <hi>I Henry IV</hi> had been in London),<note
                                          target="n6">[6]</note> we may at least postulate date
                                   limits for the <hi>Wives</hi> PB as falling roughly within these
                                   same limits, though probably performed somewhat later than the
                                   first productions of <hi>I</hi> and <hi>2 Henry IV</hi>. These
                                   suggested limits receive support from the dating of other Smock
                                   Alley prompt-books that share Hands I and III with the
                                          <hi>Wives</hi> PB and, as shown above, range in date from
                                   about 1674 to 1683. </p>
                            <p> The <hi>Wives</hi> PB is very lightly cut, only about fifty-two
                                   lines (including half-lines) being deleted, by circling, almost
                                   certainly by Hand I (compare his method of adjusting the F massed
                                   entries). Only Fenton's role is significantly cut (thirty-two
                                   lines), two cuts (II.i.52-53, 81-82) may represent some slight
                                   attempt at bowdlerizing, and all reference to the Garter ceremony
                                   (V.v. 67-77) has been omitted. Neither Hand I nor Hand III,
                                   however, makes any attempt to modernize syntax or substitute
                                   familiar for "hard" words, as happens in most of the other Smock
                                   Alley prompt-books. </p>
                            <p> W. S. Clark tells us that <hi>"The Merry Wives</hi> and <hi>Twelfth
                                          Night</hi> were as little cut for Dublin as for London
                                          performances."<note target="n7">[7]</note> If this was,
                                   indeed, true of London performances, it would help to explain why
                                   the Smock Alley <hi>Merry Wives</hi> (and <hi>Twelfth Night</hi>,
                                   only about ten lines) was so lightly cut, but I know of no
                                   evidence to substantiate such a statement. Certainly, later
                                   theatre texts are much more heavily cut (e.g., [1] as acted <!-- </page> -->

                                   omit IV.i and IV.vi (Kemble also omits V.i) and cut other scenes
                                   quite considerably (see <hi>Textual cuts</hi> for further
                                   details). The <hi>Wives</hi> PB has been compared throughout with

                                                 III.i), are made by Hand I, who, uniquely in the
                                                 Smock Alley Shakespeare prompt-books, includes, in
                                                 addition to a notation at the beginning of acts or
                                                 scenes, an advance call (except for I.i; I.ii;
                                                 II.i; V.i) anticipating the notation to follow
                                                 (e.g., II.i.213-216 'Tauern / Redy' followed by
                                                 'Tauern' at the beginning of II.ii). The closest
                                                 analogy is the use of 'scean' as an advance call
                                                 signaling a change of scene in the Smock Alley

                                                 shown by the contrasting lightness or darkness of
                                                 the ink, the advance scene notations appear to have
                                                 been added after the advance character calls were
                                                 inserted. No scene notations are marked in the MS

                                                 combined because the F text of <hi>Merry Wives</hi>
                                                 employs "massed entries" (see below), making it
                                                 difficult to discuss one without the other. Hand I
                                                 is responsible for the <!-- </page> -->
                                                 <!-- <page n=49><ID>ShaMWWP49</ID> --> character
                                                 calls, all of them advance calls. There are no
                                                 advance calls for characters entering at the
                                                 beginning of an act, but the following scenes in
                                                 each act (except V.v) have advance calls for
                                                 characters entering at the beginning of a scene, as
                                                 well as for characters entering at later points in
                                                 a scene. In <hi>Merry Wives</hi> Hand I's task was
                                                 more than usually complicated because the printed
                                                 text that serves as the basis for the Smock Alley
                                                 PB (i.e., F, like F1-2, 4) uses massed entries
                                                 (i.e., all characters who appear in a scene are
                                                 included, often in order of entry, in the opening
                                                 s.d. but without any indication of which characters
                                                 enter initially and which enter at some later point
                                                 in a scene). Hand I solved the problems posed by
                                                 the use of massed entries by circling all
                                                 characters not entering at the beginning of a
                                                 scene; he then marked the points of entry for the
                                                 other characters with 'Enter' and placed an advance
                                                 call for the characters involved in each
                                                 within-scene entry. Hand I's 'Enter' notations do
                                                 not repeat the names of the characters then
                                                 entering, the characters depending on the names
                                                 listed in the relevant advance call, Even less
                                                 specific, Hand I's use of 'Exett' or 'Exet'
                                                 ('Exeunt' is not used), being without the benefit
                                                 (as with 'Enter') of an advance call, fails to
                                                 specify whether another character exits with the
                                                 character whose exit is here indicated. Hand I
                                                 sometimes fails to mark entries and is even less
                                                 careful in marking exits, and when Ff2-4 insert an
                                                 occasional '<hi>Enter</hi>' or '<hi>Exit /
                                                  Exeunt</hi>' (rare except at the end of a scene),
                                                 Hand I depends on the F s.d. and adds no further
                                                 notation (except at III.i.74). Where a character is
                                                 sighted as about to enter, he or she is usually
                                                 brought on with 'Enter' at this point, a line or
                                                 two earlier than in edited and other theatre texts.

                                                 thirty times, drawing almost entirely on
                                                 eighteenth-century edited texts from Rowe (1709) to

                                                 occasional verbal variants and omits two lines
