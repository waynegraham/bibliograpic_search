 Introduction 

 	The purpose of this database is to make available in one comprehensive, electronically
searchable, and fully browsable list all known attributions of authorship of anonymous,
pseudonymous, or incompletely attributed articles, letters, reviews, and poems appearing in the
monthly numbers of the European Magazine from its beginnings in 1782 until its cessation in
1826 with the publication of its eighty-ninth volume.  Although the bulk of the 2,074 entries in the
database consists of attributions of authorship never before published, the list also contains every
authorial identification of material appearing in the European Magazine that I have been able to
locate in the printed work of other scholars.  I have taken care to include other researchers' finds
because, as they are often cursorily mentioned, occur in unlikely contexts, or appear in books or
articles whose titles betray no connection with the European, they would generally go unnoticed
by scholars interested in the authorship of submissions to the EM. 

 I.  The European Magazine and the Problems of Attribution 



 	The European Magazine, and London Review was launched in January 1782, dedicated
(according to its subtitle) to the mission of bringing to its readers "the Literature, History,
Politics, Arts, Manners, and Amusements of the Age."  Established by the journalist James Perry
as the mouthpiece of the Philological Society of London, the European quickly passed under the
proprietorship of the Shakespearean scholar Isaac Reed and his co-partners John Sewell and
Daniel Braithwaite, who would preside over the magazine's fortunes during its first two decades. 
A contemporary of the Gentleman's Magazine, the EM in many ways was similar to its more
famous and more successful counterpart.  Like the GM, the European consisted primarily of
articles and letters concerning literature, antiquarian matters, theology, science, biography, and
current news, backed up by sections set aside in each monthly issue for book reviews, poetry,
parliamentary reporting, theatre, and (generally) lists of births, deaths, marriages, promotions, and
bankruptcies, the whole embellished with superb engravings.  Like the Gentleman's Magazine,
the European was nonpartisan though unswervingly loyal to Church, King, and Constitution, its
editor specifically noting in 1790 that "there is not one Dissenter from the Church of England
among either the Proprietors or Conductors of this Publication." 
1   Again like the GM, the
European appealed primarily to a readership of clergymen, landed gentry, magistrates, physicians,
antiquaries, and lovers of literature, though comparative sales figures in the late eighteenth
century indicate that the EM was less successful than the GM in reaching that market, the EM's
average sales totaling 3,250 to the GM's 4,550. 
2   Unlike the GM, unfortunately, the European
offers limited opportunities for identifying the authors of the letters, articles, poems, and reviews
that fill its volumes, as no staff copy of the EM, annotated with the names of contributors and
comparable to the Nichols File of the GM, has survived. 
3   Though the authorship of a large
proportion of the EM's nearly 50,000 pages 4  remains unknown, a substantial number of
attributions can be made based on the evidence of contemporary letters, obituaries, and literary
histories; the pseudonyms and initials signed to contributions; the places whence they were sent;
internal evidence contained in the items themselves; and publication data for works from which
the EM reprinted excerpts.            

 	With the exception of Helene E. Roberts's short overview of the European Magazine
appearing in Alvin Sullivan's British Literary Magazines: The Augustan Age and the Age of
Johnson, 1698-1788 (Westport, CN: Greenwood P, 1983), pp. 106-112, the best account of the
EM previously published is 
Arthur Sherbo's 
"Isaac Reed and the European Magazine," 

Studies in Bibliography 37 (1984): 210-227, which concentrates on the years 1782-1807, the period in
which Reed was extensively involved with the magazine.  Sherbo's article amasses some 75
contributions to the EM by Reed, 18 by William Julius Mickle, and stray items by George
Steevens, Charles Burney, Henry Headley, John Hoole, Eyles Irwin, and James Bindley, besides
noting in passing William Seward's authorship of the 118 installments of the series "Drossiana"
that ran in the EM from October 1789 until Seward's death in 1799.   

 	Edward William Pitcher, because of his unmatched knowledge of eighteenth-century
serialized novels and tales as well as his expertise in many other aspects of the English and
American periodical press, has been able to provide attributions of authorship of over 200
additional items in the European Magazine, including contributions by Daniel Turner, Eliza
Gilding Turner, George Brewer, William Holloway, G. Bedingfield, and Henry Headley, as well
as possible contributions by Thomas Smith, James Hurdis, Thomas Noble, Thomas Potter,
Thomas Tomkins, and Joseph Moser.  However, Pitcher's identifications lie scattered throughout
scores of publications, 5  many of which duplicate each other in terms of information concerning
the European's authors.  Moreover, since the titles of most of Pitcher's articles focus by name
upon individual authors or upon other contemporary periodicals and contain no specific
references to the European Magazine, scholars interested in tracking down the authorship of
items in the EM all too often stumble only by chance upon the valuable information concerning
the European that may be mined from Pitcher's work.  One would have to know in advance, for
example, that Eliza Gilding Turner published poems in the EM in order to realize the relevance for
European Magazine research of Pitcher's "Eliza Gilding (Mrs. Daniel Turner): Some Facts and
Inferences," ANQ 12 (Winter 1999): 6-22.  Only upon reading the article would one find that
Pitcher in that publication identifies not only six Eliza Gilding Turner items in the European but
also eleven EM contributions by her husband, Daniel Turner, who is not mentioned in the title at
all.  In addition, in the case of a number of William Holloway's submissions to the EM and over
60 tentative Thomas Smith attributions, Pitcher, though revealing the signatures the authors used,
has not identified the particular contributions submitted by the two men, leaving to others the task
of tracking down all of the relevant entries scattered over many volumes.  I have made every
effort to remedy that omission in the present database.  

 	In compiling my own authorial identifications listed in this electronic text, I have profited
in several ways from my previous work in amassing attributions of authorship in the 
Gentleman's Magazine, 
attributions that first appeared in 
Studies in Bibliography, vols. 44-47 (1991-94) and
49-50 (1996-97), and then in my online database, Attributions of Authorship in the Gentleman's
Magazine, 1731-1868: A Supplement to Kuist (Charlottesville, Virginia: Bibliographical Society
of the University of Virginia, 1996; accessible 
electronically at

http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/bsuva/gm/).  As with the contributors to the GM, John Nichols's
Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century (9 vols.; London, 1812-15) and Illustrations of the
Literary History of the Eighteenth Century (8 vols.; London, 1817-58), as well as the obituary
columns in the Gentleman's Magazine, have proved to be invaluable sources of information
concerning the authors of items in the European Magazine.  In addition, I have found that the
same writers on occasion contributed to both periodicals, sometimes using the same pseudonyms
or initials, dating from the same addresses, and submitting materials to the GM and the EM during
roughly the same time spans.  That cross-pollination has enabled me to make various
identifications of authorship that might not have been possible otherwise. 

 II.  The Contributors 


 	The present database contains as complete a listing as I have been able to make of the
anonymous, pseudonymous, or incompletely attributed contributions of 160 men and women to
the European Magazine, including a handful of writers who were contributors to the EM only in
the sense that the EM reprinted excerpts from their work.  The largest groups among the 160
contributors contained in this list were comprised of poets, clergymen (mainly Church-of-England
clergy, though some Dissenters were included), physicians or surgeons, novelists, and dramatists. 
Smaller groups were made up of antiquaries, politicians and statesmen, civil servants and
magistrates, and literary critics (notably George Steevens and Isaac Reed, both Shakespearean
scholars).  In addition, the contributors cited in this database included classicists, barristers,
attorneys, professors, book collectors, musicians (including Charles Burney), printers and
booksellers, schoolmasters, and travelers, plus the occasional botanist (Dr. Richard Pulteney),
astronomer (Giuseppe Piazzi), Orientalist (Sir William Jones), and index-maker (Rev. Samuel
Ayscough).  The list contains eleven women, including the Della-Cruscan poet Hannah Cowley,
Eliza Gilding Turner, Mary ("Perdita") Robinson, and the prolific writer of verse and tales, Anna
Jane Vardill.  There were several American contributors: Washington Irving; the physician Joseph
Brown Ladd; Rev. Timothy Dwight, Congregationalist divine and president of Yale College; Rev.
John Vardill, titular professor of natural law at King's College (the future Columbia University)
and Loyalist spy; and William Franklin, natural son of Benjamin Franklin and last royal governor
of New Jersey.  A small handful among the 160 contributors herein listed were men whose literary
reputations would survive far beyond their own day, most notably Thomas Campbell, Thomas
Percy, Isaac D'Israeli, Sir Walter Scott, Washington Irving, and William Hazlitt. 

 III.  Leading Reviewers 

 William Julius Mickle, John Watkins, Joseph Moser, and Stephen Jones  



 	One of the intriguing questions concerning the European Magazine is the identity of the
persons who supplied material for its review section.  As noted, Sherbo 
(
Studies 37 [1984]: 224, n. 12) has identified 18 reviews by the poet and translator William Julius Mickle during the period
from 1783 through 1787 and has concluded that Isaac Reed wrote a large part of the "great body
of theatrical material" in the EM, though not all of its dramatic criticism (ibid., p. 221).  As I shall
demonstrate, it is possible to identify three contributors who successively dominated the review
section of the European Magazine following Mickle's death in 1788: John Watkins, Joseph
Moser, and Stephen Jones. 

 	John Watkins, LL.D., a former Dissenter who, after conforming to the Church of England
in the mid-1780's, opened an academy in Devon and published the popular Universal
Biographical and Historical Dictionary, contributed well over a hundred pieces (chiefly reviews)
to the European during its early years.  Of those items, the 27 installments of the series entitled
"The Peeper" were republished separately in 1796 under Watkins's name.  As for the other
contributions, conclusive proof of Watkins's authorship lies in his own letter to the GM (66-ii
[Dec. 1796]: 1017) "acknowledging myself the author of . . . every article that has appeared in the
European Magazine under the signature of 'W.'" 6   The "W." contributions--letters, articles,
verses, and especially reviews--span the 1787-96 period.         

 	Starting in 1790 Watkins's "W." reviews begin to share space with hundreds of items
signed "M." or "J.M."  It is my contention that both of those signatures were those of Joseph
Moser (1748-1819), whose signed series of stories (particularly oriental tales) and excerpts from
melodramas alone make him one of the EM's most frequent contributors.  Moser, the London-born son of a Swiss artist and nephew of the Keeper of the Royal Academy, had reluctantly
pursued a career in enamel painting until his marriage in 1780 brought him financial independence. 
After an unsatisfactory three-year retirement to the country, Moser reestablished himself in
London, indulged his longstanding interest in letters by embarking upon a prolific literary career,
and (after 1794) devoted himself as well to public duties, serving as a deputy-lieutenant for
Middlesex and as a Westminster magistrate, first in Queen Square and later in Worship Street. 7  
An 1803 memoir of Moser in the European Magazine states that "after his Muse had lain dormant
for a long series of years, he again commenced a literary career, about the year 1793, by a
correspondence with this Magazine, in which, May 1st, he published his 'Reflections upon Cash
Credit and Country Banks' . . ." (EM 44 [1803]: 84).  However, there is every reason to believe
that Moser's anonymous contributions to the EM in fact began long before that signed item,
starting at least as early as 1790. 

 	My conclusion that Moser was the author of the EM's myriad "M." and "J.M."
contributions rests on several categories of evidence.  First, there is proof positive that Moser was
the author of at least one of the "M." contributions, a verse excerpt from the as-yet-unpublished
play, Orbis; or, The World in the Moon, which the EM eventually printed under Moser's name
(EM 58 [1810]: 262-273, 333-346, 414-423).  Strong circumstantial evidence points as well to
joint authorship of Moser's signed "Brief Notice of Christ Church, Surrey" (EM 59 [Apr. 1811]:
273-277) and "M." 's review of The Ninth Number of the Antiquities of the Metropolis and its
vicinity (59 [1811]: 443), in which "M.," referring to the aforementioned Moser article, remarks
that "[o]ur readers will probably recollect, that in our Magazine for April last . . . we mentioned
this work . . . with the commendation which it merited" (p. 443).    A similar piece of evidence
connects Moser to another "M." contribution, a letter in which "M." thanks the editor of the EM
for forwarding to him a reader's correction concerning the unsigned "Brief Notices of the late Dr.
Percy, Bishop of Dromore" (EM 60 [1811]: 340-342).  Those "Brief Notices" were preceded by a
verse head note signed "Moser" and may tentatively be attributed to him. 

 	Second, the subject matter of numerous "M." and "J.M." contributions reflects Moser's
interests, attitudes, and experience.  Edward Pitcher has noted that Moser's frequent "signed
articles on the impoverished, neglected children of the parishes, on the police force, on cruelty to
African slaves, on 'Faith and Obedience', show a strong humanitarianism and sense of social
responsibility" consonant with a supporter of moral duty and of Edmund Burke's brand of
conservatism. 8   The contents of various "M." and "J.M." items suggest Moser's experience and
humanitarian sympathies as a magistrate, notably a review (EM 30 [1796]: 261-264, 341-344,
signed "M.") of A Treatise on the Police of the Metropolis (with its consideration of a proposed
asylum for "indigent . . . outcasts" [p. 262]); a letter entitled "Of Crimes and Punishments" (EM
58 [1810]: 192-193, signed "M."); a discussion (EM 61 [1812]: 442-445, signed "M.") of the
duties of magistrates in applying the laws concerning prostitution; and a review (EM 51 [1807]:
129-131, 208-211) of Patrick Colquhoun's A Treatise on Indigence , . . . with propositions for
ameliorating the Condition of the Poor, in which "J.M." roundly condemns parish workhouses
and embraces Colquhoun's call for a police gazette, averring (p. 131) that "there is no acting
Magistrate but must know the advantages of instant publicity" in detecting and preventing crime. 
Perhaps most striking in that body of material is "J.M." 's "Proposal for a Depository for Infants"
(EM 55 [1809]: 449-450), which urges the establishment of a day-care center for the use of
London's working parents, a proposition nearly two centuries ahead of its time.  The last-named
item, incidentally, refers to a recent fatal street accident in Spital Fields, the district of London in
which Moser served as a magistrate.  Several "J.M." contributions, moreover, are dated from
Spital Square.  Other "M." reviews display a considerable depth of knowledge concerning
banking, one two-part article in particular (a critique of Henry Thornton's An Enquiry into the
Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain [EM 41 (1802): 277-282, 371-375])
taking special notice of the advantages and disadvantages of country banks (pp. 374-375), a
subject upon which Moser had written in his own signed "Reflections upon Cash Credit and
Country Banks" in the European Magazine in 1793.  Even more convincing evidence of Moser's
identity is a long footnote (EM 56 [1809]: 293) in a "J.M." review of an antiquarian pamphlet, a
footnote setting forth a detailed history of painting in enamel, which was Moser's first
occupation. 9  

 	There is in addition the significance of the placement of many of the "M." and "J.M."
contributions within the magazine.  "M" items in various instances are the lead articles in the
monthly numbers, accorded a prominence befitting contributions by Moser, whose enormous
body of signed work alone made him one of the EM's most important writers.  Within the review
sections "M." critiques often directly follow "J.M." ones and vice versa, suggesting that the same
person wrote under both names on a regular basis.  Finally, there is the persuasive evidence of the
abrupt disappearance of contributions signed "M." at the end of 1813, 10  a date coinciding with
Moser's falling so desperately ill that he had to discontinue his signed articles in the EM, a fact
reported to readers in repeated monthly bulletins by the magazine's management (EM 65 [1814]:
2, 90, 186).  In every way--the linkage of Moser by name with three "M." articles, the marked and
frequent congruence of Moser's interests and experience with the subject matter of the articles
signed "M." or "J.M.," the prominent placement of those articles, and the timing of their
disappearance from the scene--the evidence is compelling that the author of the "M." and "J.M."
contributions was in fact Moser. 11  

  There are in addition a few items dating from 1807 through 1811 signed "H.R." which can
safely be attributed to Moser, not only because of the signature (the terminal letters of the name
Joseph Moser) but because several of the contributions are dated from Spital Fields and most of
them reflect Moser's experience as a London magistrate and his interest in the Spital Fields silk
industry, an interest demonstrated in several signed items (notably EM 40 [1801]: 268-275 and
466-473).  (One stray "H.R." letter sixteen years earlier [EM 20 (1791): 247] contains nothing
that conclusively proves or disproves Moser's authorship and thus is too problematical to be
attributed to him, even provisionally.)       

 Finally there are 17 items in the European Magazine signed "I.M." that must be
considered as possible Moser contributions.  Seven poems signed "I.M." appeared from October
1798 through March 1799: "The African" (EM 34 [1798]: 259), "A View of the Alps" (34
[1798]: 260), "Sonnet to Health" (35 [1799]: 120), "Morning" (35 [1799]: 187), "Noon" (ibid.),
"Evening" (ibid.), and "Night" (ibid.).  One of those seven pieces might be Moser's work: "The
African" (EM 34 [1798]: 259), a poem whose anti-slavery message mirrors Moser's outspoken
opposition to slavery and the slave trade.  The other six poems contain nothing that points to
Moser's authorship or militates against it.  Such slim evidence does not justify attributing any of
the group of seven poems to Moser. 

 	After a seven-year interlude another cluster of works signed "I.M." appeared in the second
half of 1806: a four-part review of Memoirs of Richard Cumberland (EM 50 [1806]: 36-42, 119-128, 204-209, 306-309), four reviews of additional publications (EM 50 [1806]: 199-202, 202-204, 298-302, 303-304), and two letters: "Sunday School" (EM 50 [1806]: 168), which makes
reference to Spital Fields, whence Moser had dated an item in 1805, and "Bills of Mortality and
Private Burial Grounds" (EM 50 [1806]: 254-255), which suggests Moser's experience and
interests as a London magistrate.  Since the reviews appear in the thick of Moser's numerous
contributions to the review section of the EM and since the content of the two letters is reflective
of Moser's background and interests, it seems reasonable to assign all ten of the "I.M." works
clustered in the second half of 1806 provisionally to Moser.  It is noteworthy that no additional
"I.M." items turn up throughout the rest of the European Magazine's run. 

 	It is likewise my contention that the items signed "J." that begin to appear in the European
Magazine in the late 1790's, especially in the review columns, are the work of Stephen Jones
(1763-1827), who would assume the editorial duties of the EM in 1807.  After a number of years
in the printing business, Jones upon the death of his employer in March 1797 embarked upon a
new career in journalism, becoming editor or part-proprietor successively of the Whitehall
Evening Post, the General Evening Post, the European Magazine, and the Freemasons'
Magazine.  The appearance in the EM of large numbers of reviews signed "J." begins in July
1797, a date consistent with the fact that Jones, just liberated from his duties as a printer, was
now establishing a career for himself in journalism.  Thereafter critiques signed "J." routinely
precede or follow those signed "M.," crowding the review section of the EM for a number of
years to come.  John Nichols specifically attributes to Jones one article signed "J.," a memoir (in
EM 59 [1811]: 323-327) of William Preston, a leading Freemason. 12   

 IV.  The Contributions of Anna Jane Vardill 


 	One of the European Magazine's most prolific contributors during its later years was the
writer of numerous poems and multi-part tales printed under the signature "V."  Alfred
Beauchamp, editor of the European Magazine in 1821, provides essential information concerning
the identity of "V." in his own poem, "The Editor's Compliments of the Season; to his well-beloved public, readers, contributors, and correspondents" (EM 80 [1821]: 533-534).  "Away
with all initials!--we shall give / Full names and titles in our verse to live!" Beauchamp exclaims. 
Turning to the contributor hitherto known only as "V.," he writes: 


 What, Variella, can we wish to thee? 
&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 	For thou possessest all that's dear unto man;
 Wit, Talents, Erudition, though they be 
&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 	Not always so delightful in a woman; 
 Yet those who read thy Tales and Poems, see 
&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 	A soaring mind, and genius most uncommon. 
 Still, still soar on!--In prose and verse still charm us, 
 For while thou lead'st the van, there's nought can harm us.  
 Beauchamp's lines supply four crucial clues to the identity of "V.": first, that the contributor was
a woman; second, that she was the author not only of the poems but also of the tales bearing the
signature "V."; third, that she was a person of "erudition" with "a soaring mind, and genius most
uncommon"; fourth, that her name was very likely akin to the variant "Variella"--the stem "Var"
plus a feminine ending.  The information Beauchamp provides strongly suggests that "V." was
Anna Jane Vardill (1781-1852). 

 	Anna Jane Vardill was the daughter of Rev. John Vardill, rector of Skirbeck and Fishtoft,
Lincs. (ca. 1751-1811).  Both the European Magazine and the Gentleman's Magazine record his
death (EM 59 [1811]: 156; GM 81-i [1811]: 92) and the GM supplies further details: 

 The late Rev. Dr. Vardill was educated in King's College [now Columbia
University], New York, of which he was elected principal, and appointed Regius
Professor of Divinity.  When America claimed independence, he resigned his bright
prospect there, and embraced the cause of the mother country; where he
distinguished himself by many publications worthy an acute and liberal politician. 
He was a rare example of splendid talents, devoted to the purest philanthropy; and
of profound scholastic knowledge, blended with the most endearing social virtues. 
During the last ten years, severe sickness withdrew him from those public circles,
of which his wit, eloquence, and urbanity, had rendered him the ornament; but his
memory will be treasured while those who knew him exist.  [GM 81-i (1811): 672] 

 The Alumni Oxonienses records no doctorate, noting instead that he was "created M.A. 28 June,
1774," several months after being ordained by the Bishop of London. 13   What the EM, GM, and
Alumni Oxonienses fail to mention is the fact that, though named professor of natural law at
King's College and assistant minister of New York's Trinity Church, Vardill chose to remain in
England as a Loyalist spy, ingratiating himself into the confidence of supporters of the Colonies,
surreptitiously reading their letters, and suborning the theft of correspondence between the French
government and American agents negotiating the Franco-American alliance of 1778. 14    

 	Vardill's only child, Anna Jane Vardill, was the author of two separately published works:
Poems and Translations, from the minor Greek poets and others; written chiefly between the
ages of ten &amp; sixteen, by a Lady (London, 1809) and The Pleasures of Human Life, a Poem, by
Anna Jane Vardill (London, 1812).  The European Magazine's review of the former work (55
[1809]: 140-142) quotes Anna Jane Vardill's autobiographical account with its evidence of her
extraordinary erudition: 

 'The translations, or imitations of the minor Greek poets [she writes] were the
productions of a still earlier age' (than betwixt eleven and sixteen).  'A most
indulgent father, in the retirement permitted to his station in the church, found
amusement in familiarising his only child with the poets of antiquity'. . . .  We also
learn that she passed the early part of her life at the village of Gatehouse, of Fleet
Galloway, Scotland, noted for the extensive cotton works of a near relation, and
commanding a view of the beautiful and extensive pleasure grounds, elegant
mansion, and gardens of Broughton Murray, Esq. 

 	It was in this enchanting retreat that she composed most of her poems. 
Here she pursued her studies under the guidance of [her father] the rector of
Shirbeck [a misprint for Skirbeck], of her uncle, and of her French tutor, Mr.
Cramozin, of Rouen [p. 141]. 

 The European Magazine likewise notices the second edition of Poems and Translations (EM 56
[1809]: 126-127) and The Pleasures of Human Life (61 [1812]: 275-280), again warmly praising
Anna Jane Vardill's precocity, her astonishing intellectual gifts, and the breadth of her knowledge. 
Those qualities are evidenced in the intellectual diversity displayed in the poems and popular tales
signed "V." that appear in the European Magazine from 1811 to 1822, contributions that
frequently make use of Scottish settings and occasionally display flashes of erudition.  ("V." 's
"An Arctic Islander in London" [EM 74 (1818): 289-294], for example, incorporates Greek verse
into the text [p. 291]; "V." 's carefully annotated "La Morte d'Arthur" [EM 79 (1821): 553-555]
is taken from a manuscript in the Harleian Library; "V." 's "The Eldest King of Britain" [EM 77
(1820): 166-167] was based on a passage in William Gunn's 1819 edition of Nennius's Historia
Britonum; "V." 's poem, "Another Edition of Edwin and Angelina" [EM 76 (1819): 66-67]
contains notes addressing "the Lombard-system of squaring a circle" [p. 66n] as described by
Jacob Bryant and Jeremiah Milles and directs readers to citations from Edmond Malone, William
Warburton, Richard Gough, Thomas Pennant, Thomas Warton, and Johnson.)  If further evidence
were needed to conclude that Anna Jane Vardill was "V.," it is instructive to note that in the
European Magazine for December 1817 (72: 550-551) a poem attributed by the EM to "the late
Dr. Vardill" is followed immediately by a poem signed "V.," the proximity of the two reinforcing
the identification of Anna Jane Vardill with the "V." contributions. 

 V.  The European Magazine's Final Years 


 	The declining fortunes of the European Magazine in its later years represent an all too
typical pattern among periodicals.  The European, which had prospered during its first two
decades under the leadership of the proprietary triumvirate of Isaac Reed, John Sewell, and Daniel
Braithwaite, passed in the early nineteenth century into the hands of James Asperne, an ambitious
bookseller and ardent Freemason.  Asperne quickly emerged as the magazine's driving force,
succeeding to Sewell's bookselling business upon the latter's death in 1802 and becoming sole
proprietor of the EM in 1806, when Braithwaite retired and Reed's health failed.  Upon assuming
control, Asperne hastened to assure the European's readership that he would institute no "sudden
or serious innovation" (EM 50 [1806]: 3), promised to introduce more variety into the enterprise
by way of improvement, and issued a gracious invitation to old and new contributors alike: 

 The Editors of the European Magazine have, on a former occasion, pointed out
the contributions which they would prefer, and think it not improper to repeat
them.  They are Essays, Moral and Literary, and such as illustrate dark Passages of
History; Biographical Anecdotes of Men of Eminence, either living or dead;
Letters on Erudition and Criticism; original Letters of celebrated Persons; and
Accounts of new Inventions, or remarkable Characters.  They therefore flatter
themselves, that such as have any useful knowledge to communicate, or any hint
that may improve the Mind, polish the Manners, refine the Taste, or amend the
Heart, will be glad of such an opportunity of communicating, as the Editors of the
European Magazine will be always ready to convey it to the Public.  [Ibid.] 

 	Asperne conducted the magazine until his death in 1820; and thereafter the European,
which had preserved much of its original character under his careful and astute leadership, fell
upon difficult and uncertain times.  The contents of the magazine immediately reflected the
change, with "The Editor's Conversazion&#xE9;," a pretentious journalistic affectation, now heading
each monthly number and with fewer short pieces, particularly short pieces signed with initials,
appearing in the EM's pages.  In 1822 the European acquired a new publisher, Lupton Relfe, the
passage marking the first of four changes in publishing house over the course of the EM's final
four years of existence.  "The Editor's Conversazion&#xE9;" came to a merciful end after April 1822,
the editor, Alfred Beauchamp, admitting that it had "entailed considerable ridicule on the
European Magazine" (EM 81 [1822]: [290]).  Short contributions all but disappeared, giving way
to long articles bearing few signatures (pseudonymous or otherwise) and a greatly expanded
section devoted to anonymous reviews, a format discouraging to the identification of attributions
of authorship.  When John Miller, the fourth new publisher in four years, assumed control in
September 1825 (after no monthly numbers had appeared for July or August), the conductors
commenced a new series, unceremoniously returned the previous publisher's accumulated
manuscripts, and greeted the EM's readers and former contributors with a blunt "Avis":  "If what
we have seen be a fair sample, we decline drawing from the old cask--we must have liquor more
sparkling, and with more flavour . . . ," ran the management's trenchant remarks.  "How it may be
in other quarters we know not, but in our circle we perceive that men have ceased to live on
acorns since the invention of bread."  (EM n.s. 1 [1825]: 2)  The European Magazine had, it is
true, "been established nearly half a century, but the national taste has, within the last few years of
that period, elevated itself in a most surprising manner. . . .  A school-boy of the present day
would laugh at the poetry which made his father weep; . . . and the good sense of our young
women rejects as mawkish, or enjoys only as ridiculous, the die-away trash of the Arthurs and
Dorindas, over which their antiquated aunts shed floods of youthful tears."  ("Prologue," EM n.s.
1 [1825]: 3-4)  That being the case, the new management was determined upon root-and-branch
change: 

 [W]e have considered it essential . . . to abandon the periodical biography of
unknown persons, illustrated by bad likenesses of faces which nobody had ever
seen before, or ever wished to see, and to discard in the poetical department such
things as sonnets to rose leaves, or lines to 'Moles on Mary's cheek!'  We also
consider as superfluous, communications descriptive of illegible inscriptions upon
undiscovered tomb-stones, or details of storms which never happened, meteorites
which never fell, of trees that never grew, and fish which never swam.  We
propose to cull materials from men and manners, from the world in which we live,
. . . which by care in the selection, we hope to render acceptable to all classes of
our readers.  [Ibid., p. 4] 

 	The new regime did not succeed in enticing the reading public.  The European Magazine
ceased publication in June 1826 with the conclusion of volume 2 of the new series, the eighty-ninth volume since the magazine's inception forty-five years before.  The conductors gave their
readers no intimation of the European's imminent demise.  The magazine simply sank, "like a
drop of rain, / . . . with bubbling groan-- / . . . unknelled, uncoffined, and unknown." 15  

 VI.  How to Use the Database 

 	Attributions of Authorship in the European Magazine, 1782-1826, is designed to be
searchable electronically by volume number, page number, date, title, author, pseudonym, and key
word.  To facilitate key-word searches I have furnished complete names of persons whenever
possible, full titles of books being reviewed, and interpolated names or phrases when needed for
clarity or to reveal the contents of omnibus articles with non-descriptive titles.  Users conducting
key-word searches should take into account the fact that I have preserved the original spelling of
words that appear in the titles of articles and books being reviewed.  All of the 2,074 attributions
of authorship are cross-listed, appearing first in the Chronological Listing in the European
Magazine and then in the Synopsis by Contributor.  The items in the Chronological Listing make
use of the following abbreviations in the designation of contributions to the European Magazine:   
          


	  					
	A:  Article or tale 
	L:  Letter 
	R:  Review 
	V:  Poetry 
	N:  Note  

 In the Chronological Listing the justification for each attribution is provided in brackets, the
abbreviation "Sig." indicating attributions assigned on the authority of frequently used
pseudonyms or initials.  The Synopsis by Contributor consists of an alphabetical listing of all of
the 160 contributors whose work is identified in the database, providing birth and death dates as
well as occupations of the contributors (when that information is available) and listing by volume,
date, and page numbers each author's contributions to the European as set forth in the
Chronological Listing.  Both the Chronological Listing and the Synopsis by Contributor are
designed to be fully browsable, so that readers may see each citation within its proper context.

Pitcher's "Thomas Harwood (1767-1842): The Young 'Clio' of The Westminster Magazine and

compilation of this electronic text. 

	 6:   Arthur Sherbo in "A Neglected Critic Of Shakespeare's Poetry" (Shakespeare Quarterly
33 [Spring 1982]: 102) takes note of the first "W." item to appear in the EM, a letter (11 [1787]:
414-416) enclosing remarks on Malone's Venus and Adonis, and "hazard[s] the guess, admittedly
a wild one, that [George] Steevens was W."  Watkins's statement in the GM noted above
effectively disproves that possibility.

	 8:   "Some Emendations to Melvin R. Watson's Checklist of Eighteenth-Century Magazine
Serials," Notes and Queries n.s. 23 (Nov. 1976): 508. 

	 9:   A contribution of 1801 at first glance seems to cast a doubt upon Moser's authorship of
the "M." items, as it seems to militate against a specialized knowledge of painting on the part of
the reviewer.  In his critique of James Malton's The Young Painter's Maulstick, being a practical
Treatise on Perspective; containing Rules and Principles for Delineation on Planes, "M." is
quick to minimize his own knowledge of the subject: "[D]iffident of our own judgment respecting
so important a branch of the polite arts as delineation, and aware likewise that too many young
pupils at the Royal Academy revolt at the idea of the close application which the study of
perspective requires, we thought it our duty to consult two very eminent artists, holding the first
degree of reputation in the estimation of the public as historical and landscape painters. . . . 
Respecting a work of this nature," he adds, "little can be said by a general reviewer of literature,"
and it is incumbent upon him in such a case "to rely on the authorities of professional men . . ."
(EM 40 [1801]: 41).  However, it is important to remember that Moser, though trained in the
Royal Academy, was (as his memoir in the European Magazine states) an indifferent artist at best,
who took up his profession "with reluctance, . . . made no great progress . . . , [and] took every
opportunity to fly from the study of the objects around" to the more congenial pursuit of literature
(EM 44 [1803]: 84).  Moreover, his specialty was enamel painting, not landscapes requiring
knowledge of perspective, and in any event he had abandoned the profession some twenty years
before the 1801 review of Malton's treatise appeared.  Far from disproving Moser's authorship,
the review may merely reflect an unwillingness on Moser's part to claim an expertise he felt he did
not have; and the reference to "many young pupils at the Royal Academy revolt[ing] at the idea of
the close application which the study of perspective requires" may be read as a rueful commentary
on his own lackluster artistic efforts. 

	10:   Moser may have contributed a poem and a short note, both signed "M.," to the EM the
following year (66 [1814]: 146 and 202, respectively), but those attributions are tentative at best.
Thereafter the signature "M." does not recur until 1818, by which time there is no evidence to tie
Moser to the affected items, which are few in number.  The signature "J.M.," for its part, vanished
from the EM for several years after 1811, reappearing in 1815-16, probably as the signature of a
person other than Moser. 

	11:   Edward Pitcher ("Further Emendations to Melvin R. Watson's Checklist of Eighteenth-Century Magazine Serials," Notes and Queries n.s. 27 [Feb. 1980]: 63) notes in passing that the
"J.M." who contributed some of the numbers of "Essays, Historical, Literary, and Moral," to the
EM from December 1805 through October 1810 possibly was Joseph Moser, but he does not
pursue the matter further.
