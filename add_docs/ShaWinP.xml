      Macbeth and Measure for Measure, aside from the fact that it is part of the
     same University of Padua First Folio, rests on the initials `T S.' found three times in this
     prompt-book and once in Macbeth. In Macbeth `T S' plays the role of the
     Doctor in IV.iii; in Winter's Tale he plays a Servant in III.ii and V.i and apparently
     a 'Lord' in V.i. 178 (though it is possible that his second appearance in V.i is as a Servant
     again). In the General Introduction I identified `T S' as a certain `Tho: Slender' who had
     performed in Sir Edward Dering's private production of The Spanish Curate about 1624,
     and on the basis of these initials and other similar evidence I suggested further that the
     Padua prompt-books should be assigned to Sir Edward Dering and his group of amateurs.[1] The prompt-hand that is common to the Padua Macbeth and Measure for Measure
     does not appear in The Winter's Tale. The prompt-hand in The Winter's Tale
     (and I can detect only a single hand at work) is of a more markedly secretary cast than that in
     the other two plays and its spelling forms are noticeably more archaic. Moreover, the owner of
     this hand employs advance calls for his entering characters and some other anticipative
     notations, a characteristic which at once distinguishes him from the reviser-prompter in the
     other two  Padua prompt-books. This use of advance calls
     would seem to suggest a later date for The Winter's Tale prompt-book, but, as I have
     noticed in the General Introduction,[2] such a system of advance calls
     was coming into fashion around 1625-31 and might well be found in a prompt-book contemporary
     with ones still using the older system. One particular prompt-notation also suggests a
     pre-Restoration date: the prompter's addition of the direction `fflurrish' at five (probably
     six) places in the text (all non-anticipative) where there is nothing in the Folio to suggest
     such a direction.[3] So far as I know, Restoration prompters rarely
     used the term `flourish'; where they noted such calls they more generally employed some form
     like 'Trumpet sounds' (Smock Alley Othello, IV.i.225) or `So&lt;u&gt;nd here' (Smock
     Alley Hamlet, I.iv.6), the sounding being prepared for by an advance call `Trumpet
      ready'.[4] The Padua Winter's Tale was probably never completed for production. Although the
     calls for characters are carried through the whole play, the cutting of the play stops with Act
     I, Scene ii; a fate similar to that which later overtook the Smock Alley Winter's
     Tale. Such a state of affairs, however, reverses the usual procedure, cutting (at least a
     preliminary cutting) being ordinarily completed before the character calls or other
     prompt-notations were inserted. Another unusual feature is the assignment to a particular actor
     (`T S.') of two small roles at this very early stage in the preparation of the prompt-book.  The prompter is quite erratic in his use of advance calls for the characters, some calls
     being thirty lines ahead, some as little as seven or eight lines. His `Act' calls are also
     erratic, one  (for Act III) not being anticipative at all
     (see the Collations). Apart from the character and act calls, with one exception, the notations
     are non-anticipative. The exception is the advance call for the `Satire Dance' at
     IV.iv.339-341, a call which is repeated at the point where the dance occurs. The prompter makes
     no attempt to mark point of entry for his characters when they are called within a scene, and,
     as usual, there are no calls for characters at the beginning of an act. In general, the
     prompter deals accurately enough with the frequent massed entries found in the Folio text (see,
     however, I.ii.204 and III.ii.4-6).  Because the Padua Winter's Tale prompt-book represents an unfinished cutting of the
     play, one which could never have reached production, only two pages have been reproduced in
     facsimile: sigs. [2B6]v (p. 300), 2C1r (p. 301). The
     collation, however, records, as usual, all the prompt-calls, notations, etc. for the play as a
     whole.  No full acting text of The Winter's Tale is available before Thomas Hull's Covent
     Garden version which appeared in Bell's Shakespeare, Vol. V (1773).[5] I have used this and J. P. Kemble's Drury Lane version (1802) for comparison with
     the Padua prompt-book. I have also compared where possible the Smock Alley (unfinished)
     prompt-book (c. 1670-85) and the cuts in the Collier-Perkins Second Folio. 1. Shakespearean Prompt-Books of the Seventeenth Century, Vol. I, Part i

        in the `Officers' of the F s.d with Leontes and
       the Lords; PB, however, enters the `officer' (see below) with Hermione at 11. There is no
       indication that scene i is omitted in PB; the lack of a call for Cleomenes and Dion is
       regular at the beginning of an act. In this connection, however, we should note the failure
       to place a call for Cleomenes and Dion in the next scene (see below, III.ii.4-6). Hull omits
       the first scene; Kemble places it earlier, after II.ii.III.ii(opening) ([2A5]v) fflurrish / [line] ] This is the first of a number

        `Officers'. The F `Ladies', who accompany Hermione, is also omitted, an
       omission which points in the same direction as the single `officer': a desire to cut down the
       number of extras. However, the Padua Macbeth and Measure for Measure tend to omit F
       directions for `Attendants', etc. who have no speaking parts. PB also omits any call for
       Cleomenes and Dion later in the scene, a direction likewise, of course, omitted in F which

       other cases (cf.III.ii.130-132; V.i.69-70); hence it is possible that the Lord's part is
       taken by the Servant, the role played by 'T S' earlier in the scene.In the left top
       margin above the top rule, `5600 ld:' has been written, possibly in the same hand as that
       used elsewhere throughout this PB. I cannot connect the notation in any way with the PB as
       such, nor does the abbreviation `ld:' in its context seem to have any meaning (`lb:', of
       course, would give an easy reading and was used for pounds sterling, but the last letter is
       clearly a `d'). It is a curious coincidence that `ld:' could mean `Lord' and that `Lord' is
       the missing role-title connected with `T S.' (see the reproduction of this page).178 ([2B6]v] PB opposite this line and beside the center rule shows
       some badly smeared letters which may have been initials or the beginning of a word. The
       position of the smeared letters makes it uncertain whether they refer in some way to 178 or

       and `The Names of the Actors', PB has the notation `fflurrihell' which looks like a
       portmanteau of `fflurrish' and `fflorizell'. It is, I think, an error for `fflurrish' (though
       there is no indication of a `flourish' in F), although the unlikely possibility remains that
       it is a garbled call for Florizel to speak some kind of epilogue.</field><field name="file_s">ShaWinP</field></doc><doc><field name="id">d1e425</field><field name="slug_s">/bsuva/promptbook2013/</field><field name="project_s">Shakespearean Prompt-Books</field><field name="section_s">div2_1.1</field><field name="title_s">Shakespearean prompt-books of the seventeenth century, vol. 2 (Padua Winter's Tale) </field><field name="fulltext_t">I.i.(2A1r)] PB partly circles this whole scene for deletion.

       to delete Camillo's name reflects the prompter's regular handling of the F massed s.d's and
       hence in itself tells us nothing; since the play begins with scene ii, there are no calls for

       omission which points in the same direction as the single `officer': a desire to cut down the
       number of extras. However, the Padua Macbeth and Measure for Measure tend to omit F
       directions for `Attendants', etc. who have no speaking parts. PB also omits any call for
       Cleomenes and Dion later in the scene, a direction likewise, of course, omitted in F which

       other cases (cf.III.ii.130-132; V.i.69-70); hence it is possible that the Lord's part is
       taken by the Servant, the role played by 'T S' earlier in the scene.In the left top
       margin above the top rule, `5600 ld:' has been written, possibly in the same hand as that
       used elsewhere throughout this PB. I cannot connect the notation in any way with the PB as
       such, nor does the abbreviation `ld:' in its context seem to have any meaning (`lb:', of
       course, would give an easy reading and was used for pounds sterling, but the last letter is
       clearly a `d'). It is a curious coincidence that `ld:' could mean `Lord' and that `Lord' is
       the missing role-title connected with `T S.' (see the reproduction of this page).178 ([2B6]v] PB opposite this line and beside the center rule shows
       some badly smeared letters which may have been initials or the beginning of a word. The
       position of the smeared letters makes it uncertain whether they refer in some way to 178 or

       there is no indication of a `flourish' in F), although the unlikely possibility remains that
