       Camillo's comments in 213-214 and 215-216. The  failure
       to delete Camillo's name reflects the prompter's regular handling of the F massed s.d's and

       indication that scene i is omitted in PB; the lack of a call for Cleomenes and Dion is
       regular at the beginning of an act. In this connection, however, we should note the failure

        `Officers'. The F `Ladies', who accompany Hermione, is also omitted, an
       omission which points in the same direction as the single `officer': a desire to cut down the
       number of extras. However, the Padua Macbeth and Measure for Measure tend to omit F
       directions for `Attendants', etc. who have no speaking parts. PB also omits any call for
       Cleomenes and Dion later in the scene, a direction likewise, of course, omitted in F which

       other cases (cf.III.ii.130-132; V.i.69-70); hence it is possible that the Lord's part is
       taken by the Servant, the role played by 'T S' earlier in the scene.In the left top
       margin above the top rule, `5600 ld:' has been written, possibly in the same hand as that
       used elsewhere throughout this PB. I cannot connect the notation in any way with the PB as
       such, nor does the abbreviation `ld:' in its context seem to have any meaning (`lb:', of
       course, would give an easy reading and was used for pounds sterling, but the last letter is
       clearly a `d'). It is a curious coincidence that `ld:' could mean `Lord' and that `Lord' is
       the missing role-title connected with `T S.' (see the reproduction of this page).178 ([2B6]v] PB opposite this line and beside the center rule shows
       some badly smeared letters which may have been initials or the beginning of a word. The
       position of the smeared letters makes it uncertain whether they refer in some way to 178 or
       to 232-233 (the end of the scene).227 ([2B6]v) Autolicus / gentleman / [line]233 ([2B6]v) fflurrish / [line] ] PB's notation, placed below the

       there is no indication of a `flourish' in F), although the unlikely possibility remains that
       it is a garbled call for Florizel to speak some kind of epilogue.</field><field name="file_s">ShaWinP</field></doc></add>
