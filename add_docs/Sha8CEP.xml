      Dream and The Winter's Tale, strictly considered, is not a prompt-book. It
     contains no scene settings, actors' names, advance character calls, calls for stage properties
     or sound effects, and act notations.[1] What it offers is a text of
     the play as it appears in the Third Folio (1663/ 64) fairly heavily cut for acting, possibly,
     as R. C. Bald has suggested, to be presented as an afterpiece.[2] If we accept Bald's suggestion, the Errors PB should most probably be dated sometime
     after 1700, since before that date afterpieces were rarely included as part of an evening at
     the theatre.[3] Though considerably cut the Errors PB is
     still somewhat  too long (about 1,215 lines) for the average
      afterpiece,[4] and such external and internal evidence as the
     prompt-book affords, admittedly slender, suggests that it was probably prepared at Smock Alley
     sometime before 1700. It was, we know, part of the same copy of the Third Folio in which the
     seventeenth-century Smock Alley prompt-books were prepared before that volume was finally
     broken up by Halliwell-Phillipps around the middle of the nineteenth century.[5] This common provenience, though suggestive, proves nothing, of course, so far as
     dating is concerned. Internal evidence in the Errors PB depends entirely on an
     analysis of the revising hands responsible for the cutting.  The Errors PB contains one main revising hand (Hand I). Hand I is responsible, I
     believe, for most of the cutting, a few changes in the Folio stage directions, all but possibly
     three of the linking bits of added dialogue, and probably the greater number of the single word
     substitutions. So far as I am able to judge, Hand I occurs nowhere else in the Smock Alley
     prompt-books and so offers no relatively datable link with other Smock Alley prompt-hands. What
     appears to be a second hand (Hand II) is found most clearly in a number of 'stet' notations
     (see I.i.99-109; III.i.86-106; III.ii.33-40; V.i.52-54, 58, 61), notations that are noticeably
     and consistently different from Hand I's 'stet' notations.[6] Besides
     restoring some of Hand I's cuts, Hand II is probably responsible for some of the single word
     substitutions and perhaps for three of the linking tags (see I.i.65-78, 88-95; III.i.108-114).
     Hand II may be the same as Hand II in the Smock Alley Henry VIII (see 'stet' at
     I.iv.37-38; II.ii.97-107; II.iv.38), a hand that also appears in the Smock Alley Lear
     (Hand II) and perhaps as Hand V in the Smock Alley Hamlet.  Whether, however, Hand II's work as a whole, apart from
     the use of 'stet', in Errors and Henry VIII, is indeed by the same hand, it
     is, I think, nearly certain that at least the 'stet' notations, associated above with Hand II
     in both plays, are by the same hand, in themselves representing possibly a third hand common to
     both prompt-books. This 'stet' link, then, between Errors and Henry VIII,
     since the Henry VIII PB can be dated as not later than 1682,[7] suggests (though does not prove) a seventeenth-century provenience for the Smock
     Alley Errors.  Already the shortest of Shakespeare's plays (1,753 lines),[8] the
     Third Folio text of Errors has been cut by about 538 lines (a figure including
     half-lines), leaving a play of about 1,215 lines. The principal cuts (of 10 lines or more) are:
     I.i.65-78; II.i.8-42, 88-111; II.ii.26-40, 65-111, 32-148, 172-182; III.i.87- 97; III.ii.45-58,
     159-169; IV.iii.16-35; V.i.75-84, 92-108, 138-154, 231-253, 397-406. Adriana's role is
     proportionately the most heavily cut, and the character of Balthazar has been omitted, his
     lines, when uncut, being spoken by Angelo. In addition to his omission of Balthazar, Hand I
     makes two other, apparently quite senseless, rearrangements. The first occurs in III.ii, where
     Hand I decides to make Antipholus of Syracuse exit with Luciana at line 70, thus clearing the
      stage.[9] He then begins a new scene and, following line 70, brings
     Dromio of Syracuse and Antipholus of Ephesus on together, these two carrying on the dialogue
     describing Luce the kitchen maid through line 151, at which point, realizing that only
     Antipholus of Syracuse could take part in the following exchange with Dromio of Syracuse, he
     exits Antipholus of Ephesus, after a new two-line speech (only partly legible), and enters
     Antipholus of Syracuse. As a result of this rearrangement, Dromio of Syracuse's farcically
     exaggerated description of Luce loses all point when addressed to Antipholus of Ephesus, who,
     as her master, must already know her. The second alteration is much slighter but equally
     difficult to understand. Near the end of V.i, at line 414, the first two lines of Dromio of
     Syracuse's speech are assigned, again by Hand I, to Dromio of Ephesus, and the third line (416)
     is reassigned to Dromio of Syracuse. So far as I can see, this  redistribution of the dialogue makes nonsense, and I can
     only suppose that here (as in III.ii) Hand I has fallen victim to his own comedy of errors.  The confused nature of Hand I's alterations and the absence of the other stigmata
     characteristic of a prompt-book make it clear, of course, that the Smock Alley Errors
     could never have served as a prompt-book unlike the probably somewhat earlier 'Nursery'
      Errors, which was produced not later than 1677.[10] Had the
     Smock Alley Errors been produced, however, it would probably have been very similar to
     the version that emerged under Hands I and II (with Hand I's unhappy alterations ironed out).
     Together the 'Nursery' PB and the Smock Alley Errors extend our knowledge of the
     acting tradition by nearly a hundred years, the first post-Restoration performance of the play
     of which we possess an acting text being Thomas Hull's adaptation (acted 1762, privately
     printed 1770, revised edition 1793).[11] The cuts and other changes in the Smock Alley Errors PB have been compared
     throughout (see Collations) with: (1) the 'Nursery' Comedy of Errors PB (not later
     than 1677; about 1,375 lines), (2) Thomas Hull's 1793 revised adaptation of The Comedy of
      Errors (about 1,544 lines); (3) The Comedy of Errors (about 1,565 lines), edited
     by Francis Gentleman in Vol. VIII, 1774, of John Bell's Shakespeare's Plays, As they were
      performed at the Theatres Royal in London (Gentleman only suggests cuts but claims no
     authority for them as representing performance at either Drury Lane or Covent Garden); (4)
      The Comedy of Errors in Mrs. Inchbald's British Theatre, Vol. I (1808),
     essentially Hull's adaptation (see Collations); (5) John Philip Kemble's acting text (1815) of
      The Comedy of Errors (essentially the same as Inchbald; see Collations). Occasional
     reference is made to the Douai MS of The Comedy of Errors (l694);[12] the so-called Collier MS; and William Woods' The Twins, or Which Is
      Which (1780; see note 4).   1. The Smock Alley Errors will be referred to by the abbreviation PB. It
     is worth noting, perhaps, that the Smock Alley Midsummer Night's Dream, though only an
     unacted cutting like the Errors PB, includes scene settings (see Vol. VII of this
     series). It is possible, therefore, that the absence of scene settings in Errors
     reflects the revisers' intention to use a single setting for the whole play (see Introduction
     to the Smock Alley Henry VIII PB, p. 19). Capell first introduced a single setting
     ('Ephesus. A publick Place.') and is followed by Gentleman (see below); Hull,
     Inchbald, and Kemble (see below) introduce a number of scene changes, following Pope.  2. "Shakespeare on the Stage in Restoration Dublin," PMLA, 56 (1941) 373.   3. See The London Stage 1660-1800, Part I: 1660-1700 (ed. William Van

       became'). 42-46 till my...under  47-49 the
        pleasing punishment. . . was:] Boxed and crisscrossed; Hand I substitutes, in right
       margin, with a cross before 42 and after 48, 'where sone / wee liv'd' (probably 'time' after
       'sone' has been shaved off in binding and Hand I intended to write 'some' instead of 'sone',
       thus reading 'where some time / wee liv'd'). See 39 for NPB; Hull+ reduce to 'By prosperous
       traffic 'till my factor's death, / Drew us unwillingly to Epidamnum.' 50
        she] wee Hand ?II (so Hull+). 62 we not saild]
       Hand ?II inserts 'not' after F 'we'. 65-78 Gave any . . . us.]
       Partly boxed and crisscrossed; Hand ?II substitutes, in right margin, with a cross following
       'deep' (64), 'ran [sic] was t&lt; &gt; / to watry m t&lt; &gt; / tains which t&lt; &gt; /
       moment t&lt; &gt; / ned sure d t&lt; &gt; / tion' (the addition probably read 'was turn'd /
       to watry moun / tains which each / moment threat / ned sure destruc / tion'. NPB cuts 64-67
       (substituting 'a storm aros t&lt;e&gt; / which Did conuay'), 70-76; Hull+ cut 70-76. 88-95 Was carried . . . came,] Boxed; 91 separately crossed through.
       NPB cuts 84-88; Hull+ cut 81, 85, 89-91, 94, 95 ('oh let . . .')-96. 
        99-109Merch. Oh had . . . woe,] Hand II reduces these lines to 'At last Our helpless Ship
       was splitted in the midst; / Her part, poor soul,'; 108 ('seeming . . .')-109 crossed
       through, but marked 't&lt;st&gt; et' by Hand II; speech-prefix deleted in error. NPB cuts
       99-111 ('. . . they'); Douai MS and Hull+ read 'helpless'(Hull+ following Rowe) for F
       'helpful!' (es in PB); Hull+ cut 97 ('do . . .')-101, 103, 105-107, 109 ('but . . . woe,').
        116-121 And would. . . mishaps.] Boxed and crisscrossed (NPB cuts
       116-118; Hull+ cut 114-115, 118-123 ['. . . to']). 133 Greecia] Hand ?II
       corrects F's 'Greene'; F1 Greece'. 147-149 But though . . .

       substitute 9 new lines in place of F 104-105).  II.i 8-42 Time is . . . trie:] 8-14 boxed and crisscrossed; 15-42
       criss-crossed (so NPB; Hull+ cut 8, 21, 23, expand 31 to 9 lines, rephrase 32-35, with some
       rewriting throughout). A short line under the beginning of 3 suggests that the cut was
       originally thought of as including 4-7. 43 O Here comes] Hand ?I inserts
       'O' before F 'Here'. 43 now is . . . nie.] Crossed through (NPB
       substitutes 'you'l/ heare news of him.' for F 'is . . . nie.'). 88-111
        Whil'st I . . . will:] Cut in several stages: 88 crossed through; 89-105 boxed and
       crisscrossed; 106-108 boxed and crisscrossed; 110-111 boxed and crisscrossed. NPB cuts
       88-116; Hull+ cut 103 and rewrite 106-111; Collier MS cuts 109-111. 116Luc. How many . . . Jealousie?] Crossed through (so NPB, Hull+).  II.ii 26-40 Antiph. Because that . . . beaten?] Boxed and crisscrossed (NPB
       cuts 26-39; Gentleman suggests cutting 31-32; Hull+ cut 34-39 ['. . . shoulders, but']). 65-111Ant. Well sir, . . . yonder?] Hand I substitutes, along right margin, 'Hold leave
       your prating: see who beckens / to us yonder' ('prating' written above a deleted 'jesting').
       The new speech is obviously meant to be spoken by Antipholus of Syracuse, but the only
       indication of where it is to be inserted is a small cross placed across the center rule
       opposite 63 (a short speech by Dromio of Syracuse). NPB cuts 67-110; Gentleman suggests
       cutting 67-111; Hull+ cut 48-56, 60-111 ('. . . soft,') and add 3 lines (using F 'who wafts
       us yonder?' [111] before Adriana's and Luciana's entrance). 123-127 Thy self
        . . . love:] 123-125 boxed and crisscrossed; 126-127 separately deleted by a line under
       and after F 'love:'. NPB cuts 126-148; Hull+ cut 124-125. 128 gulfe,]

       cutting 134-135, 141-146; Hull cuts 142-143, 146; Inchbald, Kemble cut 131 ['and not me
       too.']-148). 149 dame] Lady Hand ?II. 172-182
        Abetting him. . . confusion.] Crisscrossed and partly boxed; a marginal line above 170
       and below 188 suggests that 170-188 was first considered as a cut. NPB cuts 173-182; Hull+
       cut 171-172 end rewrite 176. 202 'Tis true . . . grasse.] Crossed
       through (Hull+ reduce 190-204 to 3 half-lines, place 205-213 after 214-218 [partly
       rewritten], and replace 219-221 with a 16-line soliloquy by Dromio of Syracuse). 210 And shrive . . . pranks:] Crossed through (so NPB; see 202 for Hull+).

       and crisscrossed; F speech-prefix cut at 27 when it was decided to cut 27-29, leaving 30
       unassigned. Hull+ cut 13-18, 21-29, 33, 40-41, 45-47. 50-56 and
        so...blow.] Boxed and crisscrossed (NPB cuts 50-53, 55-57; Gentleman suggests cutting
       52-60; Hull+ cut 49 ['Faith . . .']53, 55-57 ['. . . me in.']). 59-60Ant. You'll cry . . . Town?] Boxed and crisscrossed (so Gentleman, Hull+). 65-68 If you . . . hither.] Boxed and crisscrossed (Gentleman suggests
       cutting 70-83; Hull+ replace 65-84 with 15 lines by Hull). 71-72 Your cake .
        . . sold.] Boxed and crisscrossed (see 65-68 for Gentleman, Hull+). 75-77E. Dro. A man . . . hinde.] Boxed and crisscrossed (see 65-68 for Gentleman and
       Hull+). 85Balth.] Ang: Hand I (cf. 19 above). 86-106 Herein you .
        . . possession.] Confusingly marked: the final intention seems to have been to retain
       86 (perhaps 86-88) and 98-100, these lines being restored in each case by 'stet' at left of
       center rule, the two 'stet's (i.e., 'Stet' and 'stet'), however, being in different hands,
       the first by Hand I, the second by Hand II. Originally only parts of this speech seem to have
       been cut: 89-91 and 94-97 being separately boxed and crisscrossed, 101-102 being crossed
       through, with a line drawn between 100 and 101. Hand II writes 'stet' six times down the left
       margin, in each case opposite a separately marked group of lines, a move intended to reverse
       the complete cutting of the passage, which had been indicated by boxing lines and a large,
       heavy crisscross. Hand II's 'stet's, however, have been crossed through for 89-91 and 94-97,
       and all the 'stet's canceled by a vertical line drawn through them. Four stages may,
       therefore, be postulated: partial cutting, complete cutting, complete  restoration, and a second partial cutting. NPB cuts
       89-91, 98-106; Hull gives 85-93 to Balthazar, the remainder of the speech to Angelo;
       Inchbald, Kemble (as partially in PB) assign 85-106 to Angelo but break the speech after 93
       by inserting the last four lines of Hull's addition (see 65-68). 108-114
        And in . . . dinner,] Boxed and crisscrossed; Hand ?I substitutes, following 107, 'in
       ye / mean / time', linking with F 'get you home' in 114.  III.ii 2-8 shall Antipholis . . . blindnesse:] Boxed and
       crisscrossed; Hand ?II links 2 and 9 with 'but' in left margin opposite lo; Gentleman
       suggests cutting 5-6, 8; Hull+, after 47 lines and a 16-line song by Hull (Kemble calls for a
       song but omits Hull's lyric), cut 4, 8. 11-18 Look sweet . . .
        boord:] 13-16 first cut (boxed and crisscrossed); then 11-12 crossed through and
       11-18 boxed and crisscrossed. NPB cuts 9-24; Gentleman suggests cutting 13-20, 93; Hull+ cut
       13-14. 21-22 Alas poor . . . us.] Though . . .us] Crossed through (see 11-18 for NPB, Gentleman;
       Hull cuts 19, 23; Inchbald, Kemble cut 19-24). 27-28 'Tis holy . . .
        strife.] Crossed through. 33-40 Teach me . . . yeeld.]
       33-38 first boxed and crisscrossed; then 33 crossed through and included in a second
       crisscross, and 39-40 made part of the 33-38 cut but restored with 'stet' by Hand II, with a
       small cross below 'stet' to the left of center rule. NPB cuts 33-41; Gentleman suggests
       cutting 33-46; Hull+ cut 30-32, 35, 41 But if that] Hand ?I
       substitutes 'I say if' (Hull+ read the line as 'But if I am Antipholis, I swear'). 44 far more] my loue Hand ?I. 44
        decline] incline Hand ?1 (so NPB, Collier MS; Hull+ read 'inclines',
       rewriting the line). 45-58 Oh traine . . . night.] Boxed and
       crisscrossed (NPB cuts 45-52; see 33-40 for Gentleman; Hull+ cut 52). 70
        fetch] aske Hand I (Hull+ read 'seek'). 105-106 for why? . .
        . it.] Crossed through (Gentleman suggests cutting 103-109, 116-145 ['is spherical! . .
       . me,']; Hull+ cut 91-93 ['I such . . . reverence:'], 95, 100-143 ['if she . . . low.'];
       Collier MS cuts 103-143 ['. . . low.']). 122-132Ant. Where Scotland? . . . it.] Boxed and crisscrossed (see 105-106). 146 privie] Crossed through (Gentleman reads 'private'; Hull+ read
       'secret'). 151 turn i'th wheel] Following the conclusion of Dromio of
       Syracuse's lines at 151, Hand I gives Antipholus of Ephesus two lines written up the left
       margin (first line shaved in binding) just before Hand I exits him:'&lt;.o&gt; &lt;. . .&gt;
       &lt;. . .&gt; you on my wifes &lt;. . .&gt; / to spight her I will glue my wench her chaine'
       (see III.ii.70 s.d. 151, 152 in F stage directions altered). 159-169 As from . . . song.] 159-160 crossed through; 161-169
       crisscrossed but not boxed (Hull+ cut 157-158, 163-167 and rearrange the lines retained).
       IV.i 6 Or Ile attach] Or Ill be forcd to attach Hand 1. 7 Even] why Hand I. 8 growing to me by] owing

       'Please you but walk', following Pope). 15 house, go] house, myselfe go
        Hand I. 15 house go thou] Following the end of 15, Hand I, in
       lower margin, right center rule, writes 'not finisht yet sayest thou?'. There is no
       indication where this half-line is to be inserted, though it would appear to be for
       Antipholus of Ephesus, presumably preceding the opening line of his first speech (15), the
       'thou' referring to Dromio of Ephesus, who enters with him after 13. 17
        their] her Hand I (so Douai MS, Rowe; 'these' Collier MS; Hull+ read 17 as

       Hull+). 50-51 I should . . . brawle.] Boxed. 57-58Ant. Fie, now . . . it.] Boxed. 61 If not, . . . Officer.]
       Boxed. 78 If he . . . apparently.] Boxed. 93 now! a
        Madman! Why . . . sheep,] F 'a' and 'Why thou peevish sheep,' crossed through (NPB
       substitutes 'fellow' for F 'sheep'; Hull+ read 'now, madman!', but retain 'Why . . .
       sheep,').  110-113 Where Dowsabell . . . fulfill.] 110-111
       scratched out but marked 'Stet' by Hand I; 112-113 boxed. Hull+ cut 111-113 (later rephrasing
       111) and expand Dromio of Syracuse's 5-line concluding speech to 11 prose lines, similarly
       though differently expanded by Woods.  IV.ii 2-6 Might'st thou . . . face.] Boxed; 6 may have been first crossed
       through (so Gentleman: NPB cuts 6). 8 the more my spight.] Crossed
       through (Hull+ read 'wrong' for F 'spight'). 13-28Adr. With what . . . curse.] Boxed, but only 19-20 ('crooked . . . bodied,'), 22, 27
       were originally cut, Hand I linking the two parts of 19 and 20 with 'and' and substituting
       'base' for F 'blunt' in 21. Gentleman suggests cutting 16-22, 25-28; Hull+ read 19-20 as 'Oh,
       he is shapeless, crooked, old, and seer,', substitute 'rude' for F 'blunt' in 21, and cut
       23-24, 26, 28, substituting a 9-line speech by Luciana for F 23-24. 34-40 One whose . . . hell.] Partly boxed; 34 separately crossed through
       (Hull+ telescope 32-33 and cut 36, 39-40). 57-62Adri. As if . . . day?] Boxed (Hull+ cut 45, 50-52). 65-66 Come
        sister . . . injurie.] Boxed (so Hull+, adding 9 new lines divided between the
       sisters).  IV.iii 13-l4 what have . . . apparal'd?] Crossed through (Hull+ substitute
       'What, have you got rid of the fiend?'). 15 What Adam . . .
       mean?] Crossed through (Hull+ substitute 'fiend' for F 'Adam'). 16-35 S. Dro. Not that . . . Is there] Partly boxed; 34-35 ('. . . there')
       crossed through; Hand I, above 16, substitutes 'Dro: ye gold you sent me for:'; then, in
       place of 34-35 ('. . . there'), Hand I substitutes 'I sent thee to the bay roge to see if' to
       link with F 'any Ship puts forth to night?' in 35, the F speech-prefix 'Ant.' for Antipholus
       of Syracuse in 34 being deleted in error. Hull+ cut 16-19 ('. . . Prodigall:'), 22-23 ('. . .
       leather;'), 27 ('he that . . .')-28. 35-36 may we be gone?] Crossed
       through. 53-55 and thereof . . . wench:] Circled (Gentleman suggests
       cutting 52 ['And here . . .']-58; Hull+ cut 48-55 ['. . . wench:'], 59-81, and add 23 new
       lines following 47). 61-65 S. Dro. Master, if . . . devil!.]
       Boxed (see 53-55). 83-92 Else would . . . way.] Boxed and crisscrossed,
       but 83-86 restored with 'Stet' by Hand I (Hull+ cut 87-92, as in PB's final cutting).  IV.iv 22 Good now] Crossed through; the rest of 22 ('hold thy tongue.')
       appears to be lightly crossed through but is necessary to make sense of 23-24. 39-42 I bear . . . door.] Boxed, but cut should have begun at least with F
       'nay' preceding F 'I bear'; what looks like 'Com' (Hand ?) appears in lower margin to left of
       center rule and may be intended as a warning to move to Antipholus of Ephesus's speech at 43,
       which begins with F 'Come'. 123-124 Bear me . . . it.] Boxed (Hull+ cut
       124-133).  V.i 49-91Ab. Hath he . . . him.] These lines are set off by short lines across left rule
       above 49 and below 91; as an early provisional cut, i.e., 48 followed by 92, this makes no
       sense, but at one stage in the cutting 102-105 (later part of a larger cut) may have been
       intended to follow 48 (see 92-112 below). NPB cuts 49-90. 52-54 A sin. . .
        to?] Crossed through; 53-54 also boxed and crisscrossed, but 52 restored with 'stet' by
       Hand II (see 49-91 for NPB). 58-61 I, but . . . enough.] Crossed
       through, but 59 restored with 'stet' by Hand II (see 49-91 for  NPB). 67 it was . . . bad.]
       Crossed through, but Hand I substitutes 'how he was / to blame'. Hand I's reading is heavily
       smeared, perhaps with intention to cancel; point of insertion marked with small crosses
       before F 'it' and Hand I's 'how'. See 49-91 for NPB; Hull+ read 'it was vile and base.'. 75-84 Thereof the . . . beast:] Circled and crisscrossed (see 49-91 for
       NPB; Hull+ cut 83-84). 92-112Ab. No, not . . . him.] 92 boxed and crisscrossed; 102-105 only included in the cut
       by a single line down right center rule; 106-112 represent another separate block in the
       cutting, but 106-108 was first crossed through and then included in the larger cut by
       crisscrossing; finally, Hand I brackets 108-112 in right margin and restores these lines with
       'Stet' in right margin. Hull+ cut only 100. 118 By this . . . five:]
       Crossed through. Large stars appear in the right margin opposite F s.d. 'Enter Merchant
        and Goldsmith.'and 118 end opposite 129 end Fs.d. 'Enter the Duke . . .
        Officers.'; the purpose behind the use of these stars remains a mystery (see V.i.128
       s.d., Stage directions altered). 120 to the Melancholy vale;]
       Heavily smeared through. 137-138 Whom I . . . day,] Crossed through;
       Hand I substitutes 'who&lt;m&gt;' following 136 to link with 139 (so NPB). 139-154 took him, . . . fled] F 'took him,' (139) crossed through, as is F 'Each'
       (151) and F 'then they fled' (154), and 140-154 boxed and crossed across; Hand I substitutes,
       across right rule, 'hash taken &lt;this&gt; / ill day / is fled'. NPB cuts 142-154; Hull+ cut
       50-51 ('and himself, . . . passion,'). 155 them,] him Hand I
       (Hull+ read "em'). 158 Nor send . . . thence.] Crossed through. 161-164 Long since . . . could,] Circled (so NPB); F 'Wars' in 161 seems to
       show some sort of alteration. 169-170, 177, 180-181] Hand ?I places
       three small crosses to left of center rule, and, in left margin, opposite the third cross
       (180-181), places the following badly shaved words: '&lt; &gt;an / &lt; &gt;dly / &lt; &gt;ak
       for ['for' doubtful] / &lt; &gt;ion'. I cannot see any connection between the marginal
       notation and the text, though possibly some offstage noises are being called for, as at F s.d
       following 183 ('Cry within.'). 191-194 Even for . . . Justice.]
       Boxed (so NPB). 198 She whom . . . wife;] Crossed through (NPB cuts
       198-200). 20l-202 Even in . . . me.] Crossed through (see 198 for NPB;
       Hull+ cut 201-202). 215-217 Neither disturb'd . . . mad.] Circled and
       crisscrossed (NPB cuts 210, 215-216,229 ['. . . not.'], 237 ['Pinch . . .']-238,
       240-241, 244; Gentleman suggests cutting 224-253; Hull+ cut 214-253, 256-268, 281). 219-221 were he . . . then,] Crossed through; Hand ?I substitutes, across
       right rule, 'can  wittness / it.'; F 'Who' in 222 appears to have been
       crossed through but is necessary to the sense. A dash is inserted in PB following the end of
       218 and 222; whatever the intention, these dashes cannot, in terms of sense, mark a suggested
       cut. See 215-217. 231-253 I did . . . indignities.] Boxed and doubly
       crisscrossed (see 215-217). 302-306Fat. Dromio, nor . . . him.] Boxed (so Hull+). 311-318 Though now .

       who substitutes 'away' as a link to 354. 355 I, to . . . in.] Crossed
       through. 367-368E. Ant. Brought to . . . Uncle.] Crisscrossed (Hull+ read 'Minaphon' for F

       86 (perhaps 86-88) and 98-100, these lines being restored in each case by 'stet' at left of
       center rule, the two 'stet's (i.e., 'Stet' and 'stet'), however, being in different hands,
       the first by Hand I, the second by Hand II. Originally only parts of this speech seem to have
       been cut: 89-91 and 94-97 being separately boxed and crisscrossed, 101-102 being crossed
       through, with a line drawn between 100 and 101. Hand II writes 'stet' six times down the left
       margin, in each case opposite a separately marked group of lines, a move intended to reverse
       the complete cutting of the passage, which had been indicated by boxing lines and a large,
       heavy crisscross. Hand II's 'stet's, however, have been crossed through for 89-91 and 94-97,
       and all the 'stet's canceled by a vertical line drawn through them. Four stages may,
       therefore, be postulated: partial cutting, complete cutting, complete  restoration, and a second partial cutting. NPB cuts
       89-91, 98-106; Hull gives 85-93 to Balthazar, the remainder of the speech to Angelo;
       Inchbald, Kemble (as partially in PB) assign 85-106 to Angelo but break the speech after 93

       sense, but at one stage in the cutting 102-105 (later part of a larger cut) may have been

       crisscrossing; finally, Hand I brackets 108-112 in right margin and restores these lines with
       'Stet' in right margin. Hull+ cut only 100. 118 By this . . . five:]

        Officers.'; the purpose behind the use of these stars remains a mystery (see V.i.128

       across right rule, 'hash taken &lt;this&gt; / ill day / is fled'. NPB cuts 142-154; Hull+ cut

       show some sort of alteration. 169-170, 177, 180-181] Hand ?I places
       three small crosses to left of center rule, and, in left margin, opposite the third cross

       right rule, 'can  wittness / it.'; F 'Who' in 222 appears to have been
       crossed through but is necessary to the sense. A dash is inserted in PB following the end of
       218 and 222; whatever the intention, these dashes cannot, in terms of sense, mark a suggested
