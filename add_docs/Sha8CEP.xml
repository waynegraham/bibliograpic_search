       86 (perhaps 86-88) and 98-100, these lines being restored in each case by 'stet' at left of
       center rule, the two 'stet's (i.e., 'Stet' and 'stet'), however, being in different hands,
       the first by Hand I, the second by Hand II. Originally only parts of this speech seem to have
       been cut: 89-91 and 94-97 being separately boxed and crisscrossed, 101-102 being crossed
       through, with a line drawn between 100 and 101. Hand II writes 'stet' six times down the left
       margin, in each case opposite a separately marked group of lines, a move intended to reverse
       the complete cutting of the passage, which had been indicated by boxing lines and a large,
       heavy crisscross. Hand II's 'stet's, however, have been crossed through for 89-91 and 94-97,
       and all the 'stet's canceled by a vertical line drawn through them. Four stages may,
       therefore, be postulated: partial cutting, complete cutting, complete  restoration, and a second partial cutting. NPB cuts
       89-91, 98-106; Hull gives 85-93 to Balthazar, the remainder of the speech to Angelo;
       Inchbald, Kemble (as partially in PB) assign 85-106 to Angelo but break the speech after 93

       above 49 and below 91; as an early provisional cut, i.e., 48 followed by 92, this makes no
       sense, but at one stage in the cutting 102-105 (later part of a larger cut) may have been

       by a single line down right center rule; 106-112 represent another separate block in the
       cutting, but 106-108 was first crossed through and then included in the larger cut by
       crisscrossing; finally, Hand I brackets 108-112 in right margin and restores these lines with
       'Stet' in right margin. Hull+ cut only 100. 118 By this . . . five:]

        Officers.'; the purpose behind the use of these stars remains a mystery (see V.i.128

       across right rule, 'hash taken &lt;this&gt; / ill day / is fled'. NPB cuts 142-154; Hull+ cut

       show some sort of alteration. 169-170, 177, 180-181] Hand ?I places
       three small crosses to left of center rule, and, in left margin, opposite the third cross

       for ['for' doubtful] / &lt; &gt;ion'. I cannot see any connection between the marginal
       notation and the text, though possibly some offstage noises are being called for, as at F s.d

       right rule, 'can  wittness / it.'; F 'Who' in 222 appears to have been
       crossed through but is necessary to the sense. A dash is inserted in PB following the end of
       218 and 222; whatever the intention, these dashes cannot, in terms of sense, mark a suggested
       cut. See 215-217. 231-253 I did . . . indignities.] Boxed and doubly
