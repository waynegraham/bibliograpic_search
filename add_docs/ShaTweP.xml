       of Windsor and King Lear, contains no actors' names, but it is tied to other
      Smock Alley prompt-books (1) by inclusion in S. W. Singer's list of twelve plays in "a
      tattered copy of the third folio of Shakespeare," which showed abundant evidence of a
      theatrical provenience (i.e., the Smock Alley Third Folio [1663/64] before it was broken up by
       Halliwell-Phillipps);[1] (2) by the appearance of a prompt-hand
      (Hand I) that occurs in the Smock Alley Hamlet (Hands I and II; c. 1676-79),[2]Macbeth (Hands I and II; c.  1674-82), Henry VIII (Hand I c. 1674/75-79),
       Othello (Hand II; c. 1677-78 or 1682-83), I Henry IV (Hand II; c. 1675-85)
       andKing Lear (Hand I; ? after 1681). The presence of Hand I in these other plays,
      ranging in date from about 1674 to 1685, suggests that the Smock Alley Twelfth Night
      probably falls somewhere within the same general span. If we add to this the possibility that
      Francis Baker, who played Falstaff in I and 2 Henry IV, also played Sir Toby
      Belch (Thomas Betterton played both roles in London), then at least a terminal date of 1685,
      the year in which Baker left Smock Alley to act with the United Company in London, may be set
      for the Smock Alley Twelfth Night. Hand I, the only prompt-hand in the Smock Alley prompt-book, is responsible for scene
      settings, stage properties (one call only), sound effects, advance character calls, stage
      directions altered or added (one of each), textual cuts (five only), and textual changes (one
      only). Hand I, however, makes no attempt to modernize syntax or language. A second hand (Hand
      II), an eighteenth-century hand that also appears in the Smock Alley Hamlet (Hand
      IV), King Lear (Hand III), Merry Wives of Windsor (Hand II), and
       Midsummer Night's Dream (Hand II), as usual emends the Third Folio text by inserting
      emendations proposed by editors from Rowe (1709) through Hanmer (1743). Only selective
      readings by Hand II are recorded in the Collations (see Textual changes).  Like the Smock Alley Merry Wives, the Smock Alley Twelfth Night is very
      lightly cut (only 10 lines out of a total of 2,429).[3] Of its five
      cuts, two (I.ii.62; III.i.52-54) may have been made to remove "bawdry"; one (II.iv.87) because
      of an error in the Third Folio text that makes nonsense of the line; and two (II.iv.5-6;
      III.iv.290-292) because the passages concerned are not immediately clear in meaning. A few
      lines may possibly (though not, I think, probably) have been cut on Folio pages 265 and 266,
      where a substantial part (lower outer corner of sig. Z1) has been torn away, affecting the
      text as follows: III.i.59-99 ('bring a . . . own'), enough inner marginal text remaining to
      rule out  any cuts; III.i.124-163 ('Myself . . . pride,');
      III.ii.6-50 ('And. Marry I . . . although the'); III.ii.76-III.iii.18 ('ever believe
      . . . firm,'), enough outer marginal text remaining to rule out any cuts.  The Smock Alley Twelfth Night has been compared throughout with the following
      theatre texts (the first possibly earlier than the Smock Alley PB): Folger Second Folio
       Twelfth Night cuts about 36 lines; (2) Douai MS Twelfth Night (1694), cuts
      about 266 lines; (3) Twelfth Night in John Bell's Shakespeare's Plays, As they
       are now performed at the Theatres Royal in London, Vol. V (1773), cuts about 235 lines;
      (4) John Philip Kemble's Covent Garden Twelfth Night (n.d., about 1811), cuts about
      the same number of lines as in (3), but individual cuts differ.[4]
      The so-called Collier MS has also been consulted.  The scene settings are stock (occurring in other Smock Alley prompt-books) and are limited
      to three: 'Presence' (used once), 'Towne' (used three times), and 'Court' (used or implied
      thirteen times). The last two are the most frequently used among Smock Alley settings;
      'Presence' appears elsewhere only in Othello.[5] Obviously,
      it was not intended to mount Twelfth Night with any unnecessary expense.  Because both the Smock Alley Twelfth Night and Merry Wives[6] are, comparatively, so lightly cut, it is tempting to think that
      they may represent first steps in the preparation of the final prompt-books and that some hand
      other than the main prompt hand (Hand I in both) was expected to go over the play again with
      an eye to more substantial cutting. Against such a view, however, except for the lack of
      significant cutting, both are quite adequate to serve as actual prompt-books. Moreover, the
      comparatively small amount of cutting (c. 36 lines) in the Folger Second Folio Twelfth
       Night PB, of uncertain date and possibly earlier than the Smock Alley Twelfth
       Night, suggests that Twelfth Night at least, if not Merry Wives, was not
      considered as a play demanding much shortening. Finally, the length of both plays after
      cutting (Smock Alley Twelfth Night, c. 2,419 lines; Folger Second Folio Twelfth
       Night, c. 2,393 lines; Merry Wives, c. 2,582 lines) is considerably less than the Smock Alley acting texts of
       Hamlet (c. 2,860 lines) and Othello (c. 2,808 lines).  1. The Text of Shakespeare Vindicated (1853), pp. vi-vii.  2. For an explanation of the telescoping of Hands I and II in Hamlet
      and Macbeth, see Introduction to the Smock Alley Lear, p. 2, note 3.  3. The line-count here is based on Alfred Hart's count of 2,429 lines for
       Twelfth Night (Review of English Studies, 8 [1932], 21). Because of the
      substantial amount of prose in Twelfth Night, line-counts are more than usually open
      to variation depending on the format of the particular text being referred to.  4. Neither the Folger F2 PB nor the Douai MS Twelfth Night shares cuts
      with the Smock Alley PB.  5. See General Introduction, Vol. I: Part i, pp. 23-24, of this series.  6. See Introduction to the Smock Alley Merry Wives PB, p. 43.   II: The Folger Second Folio Twelfth Night The Folger Second Folio Twelfth Night (hereafter Folger F2 PB) has no connection,
      so far as I know, with Smock Alley and is of unknown provenience. Like the Smock Alley
      prompt-books, however, it also belonged at one time to Halliwell-Phillipps, who describes it
      in his Some Account of the Antiquities, . . . In the Possession of James Orchard
       Halliwell, Esq. F.R.S. (1852).[7] Of its history before 1852,
      however, nothing is known, although it seems probable that it has a London (or English
      provincial) rather than a Dublin origin. Whatever its provenience, Folger F2 PB was never
      completed: all prompt notations cease after IV.ii, thus ruling out its use as a workable
      prompt-book.  The absence of any scene settings in Folger F2 PB suggests a question. Does this indicate,
      perhaps, that this prompt-book should be dated some time before 1660, after which changeable
      scenery became common in the public theatres? One characteristic of this prompt-book, however,
      suggests that it is more probably post-Restoration: the marking of the point of entry for a
      character by a horizontally slanted and crossed line, an entry signal often appearing in
      Restoration prompt-books,[8] but not, to my knowledge, found in
      earlier prompt-books.  A single prompt-hand worked on the Folger F2 PB, which,  though it is the only prompt-hand, I have called Hand
      I. It has some superficial points of likeness with Hand I in the Smock Alley Twelfth
       Night PB, but it is, I am sure, a different hand, and one that does not appear elsewhere
      in other Smock Alley prompt-books. Hand I is responsible for the act notations, calls for
      sound effects, advance character calls, Folio stage directions altered or added, textual cuts,
      and textual changes. It also, with some consistency, marks points of entry with a horizontally
      slanted and crossed line (see note 8), usually placed in the right or left margin.  The Folger F2 PB has been very lightly cut (c. 36 lines, leaving a play of c. 2,393 lines),
      though slightly more heavily cut than the Smock Alley Twelfth Night. Of its four
      cuts, two (II.iii.39-47, 115-121) shorten or cut song lyrics, and two get rid of dated
      references to 'the old Hermit of Prage' and 'King Gorbodacke' (IV.ii.13-23)
      and to 'the old vice' with his 'Dagger of Lath' (IV.ii.133-141). There is no agreement between
      these cuts and those in the Smock Alley PB, further evidence, aside from Hand I,
      disassociating the Folger F2 PB from a possible Smock Alley provenience.  The Folger F2 PB has been compared throughout with the same theatre texts listed above for
      the Smock Alley Twelfth Night.  7. P. 115, Item 91: "The Play of Twelfth Night, from the edition of 1632, a
      play-house copy of about the date 1640, with the names of the characters in the place where
      they were to be in readiness to take their parts etc. fol[io]. This volume is extremely
      interesting, as showing the plan of an early performance of the play. It is curious to observe
      how little is omitted from the original text. The places for 'Musicke' are noted. Instead of
      the song at the end of Act iv, Sc. 2, we have only the following lines, I am gone, Sir, and,
      anon, Sir / Ile be with you againe, sir." Halliwell-Phillipps fails to note that this PB was
      never completed, and the date, "about 1640," is presumably only his best guess.  8. See, for example, Hamlet and Othello (both Smock Alley;
      Folger Shakespeare Library), Comedy of Errors ('Nursery'; University of Edinburgh
      Library), John Wilson The Cheats (King's Company, London; MS at Worcester College,
      Oxford), and James Shirley, The Sisters (King's Company, London; Sion College,
      London). </field><field name="file_s">ShaTweP</field></doc></add>
