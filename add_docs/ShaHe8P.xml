                                                  hands responsible for the cutting. My general
                                                  assumption is that Hand I did most of the initial
                                                  cutting (by circling lines to be deleted) at the
                                                  same time that he entered the advance character
                                                  calls, etc. and that Hand II then revised Hand I's
                                                  cuts, restored a few lines here and there,
                                                  proceeded to do some further quite substantial
                                                  cutting, and crisscrossed many of Hand I's
                                                  originally deleted lines to make their omission
                                                  clearer. It is possible, however, that some other
                                                  hand did the initial cutting by circling the lines
                                                  to be deleted and that Hands I and II only revised
                                                  the cutting as this hypothetical third hand had
                                                  left it. I associate the crisscrossing of many of
                                                  the circled cuts with Hand II because restored

                                                  example, in II.iii, where Hand I, originally
                                                  intending to retain lines 1-49 (as shown by the
                                                  position of the advance call for Anne Bullen and
                                                  the Lady placed at II.ii.117), changed his mind
                                                  and circled line 1-49 for deletion; Hand II then
                                                  restored lines 33 ('Nay, . . .)-49, placing 'Stet'
                                                  in the left margin but crisscrossing lines 1-33
                                                  ('... it.') to distinguish them as still being
                                                  deleted (compare the treatment of II.iv.18-34).
                                                  Occasionally, shorter deletions are made by
                                                  crossing through, but by what hand is uncertain.
