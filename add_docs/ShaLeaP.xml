          appears to make use of Charles Jennens' edition of Lear published in that year.

          on a copy of the Third Folio (F) text, is proved by the appearance in it of two
          prompt-hands common to some other seventeenth-century Smock Alley prompt-books (see
          below), no exact dating limits, in the absence of any actors names among the prompt
          notations, can be suggested. There is, however, one peculiar feature of the Lear
          PB that makes it probable that the production for which it was prepared, though almost
          certainly before 1700, was after 1681, the year in which Nahum Tate's notorious but
          long-lived adaptation of Shakespeare's play was first acted and published. [1] Tate, among other less radical "improvements," invented a love
          affair between Cordelia and Edgar (thus eliminating Cordelia's marriage to the French
          king), cut out the role of the Fool (not restored until 1838), and, in a "happy"
          denouement, turned the play from a tragedy into a kind of tragicomedy by allowing Lear,
          Cordelia, and Gloucester to remain alive: Lear and Gloucester,  along with Kent, totter off to 'some cool Cell' to
          reflect on 'our Fortunes past, / Cheer'd with relation of the prosperous Reign / Of this
          celestial Pair [Cordelia and Edgar]'. The Smock Alley prompt-book shows no evidence,
          structural or verbal, of influence from Tate's version until the final scene (V.iii). At
          this point all advance character calls suddenly cease, the last such call being for Edgar
          and Gloucester (at V.i.54) in preparation for their entry at the beginning of V.ii. The
          cessation of advance calls at this particular point suggests, strongly, I think, despite a
          few cuts by Hand II in V.iii, that Hand I (see below) intended to conclude the play with a
          somewhat adapted version of Tate's "happy ending." Bizarre, even unlikely, as this may
          sound, it is, in fact, exactly what George Colman concocted (except for much heavier
          cutting, some occasional Tateification, and the omission of the Fool) in his alteration of
            Lear first performed in 1768, restoring Cordelia's marriage to the French king
          and omitting Tate's sentimental love business between Cordelia and Edgar. [2]  Three hands can clearly be distinguished in the Lear PB, two prompt-hands and a third
          intrusive late eighteenth-century hand. Hand I, which appears also in the Smock Alley
            Hamlet (Hands I and II) [3]Macbeth (Hands I and II), Twelfth Night (Hand I), Henry VIII
          (Hand I), Othello (Hand II), and I Henry IV (Hand II), is responsible
          for the scene notations, the advance character calls and sound effects, and for the
          restoration of two cuts made by Hand II. Hand II, which appears also in the Smock Alley
            Henry VIII (Hand II) and perhaps in Hamlet (Hand V) initially (i.e.,
          before Hand I's work) went through the play circling lines, phrases, and single words for
          cutting, occasionally substituting new readings for words that struck him as archaic or
          "hard." Hand III, which also meddled in the Smock Alley Hamlet (Hand IV),
            Midsummer Night's Dream (Hand II), Twelfth Night (Hand II), and
            Merry Wives of Windsor (Hand II), inserts emended readings drawn from
          eighteenth-century editors from Rowe (1709) through Jennens (1770),
            [4] as well as a number  of apparently original readings.
            [5] There is no reason to think that Hand III has any connection with the
          prompt-book's earlier Smock Alley provenience. Hand III's work disappears after II.iv.
          What may be a fourth hand (though possibly Hand I) may be responsible for the emended
          reading at III.i.22-25.   The Lear PB is very lightly cut. Of the roughly 2,920 lines in the Folio text,
          Hand II marks for deletion only 123 lines and 40 half-lines (plus a few phrases and single
          words), and Hand I restores 11 of those lines, leaving a play (taking the 40 half-lines as
          equivalent to 20 lines) of roughly 2,777 lines, [6] comparable in
          length to the Smock Alley Hamlet (2,806) and Othello (2,808), the later
          theatre texts of David Garrick (2,318; first acted 1756; first printed in John Bell's
            Shakespeare's Plays, As they are now performed at the Theatres Royal in London
          , Vol. II, 1773), George Colman (2,171; first acted and printed 1768), and John Philip
          Kemble (2,009; first acted and printed 1795, here consulted in Mrs. Inchbald's British
            Theatre , Vol. IV, 1808). [7]  Except for the postulated substitution of some form of Tate's "happy ending," discussed
          above, the Smock Alley Lear (discounting Hand III's much later meddling) shows no
          significant points of contact, verbally or in cutting, with either Tate's adaptation  or the three acting texts referred to above, and they
          share with the prompt-book only a single scene setting (at IV.vii). All settings are stock
          and appear in other Smock Alley promptbooks. [8]  Certain characteristics of the Lear PB may perhaps suggest that, like the Smock
          Alley Midsummer Night's Dream, Comedy of Errors , and Winter's Tale , it
          was laid aside and never reached actual production: (1) the absence of actors' names among
          the prompt notes (contrast the Smock Alley Macbeth, Hamlet, Othello, Henry VIII,
          and I and 2 Henry I V );  [9] (2) the failure
          of Hand I (or some other hand) to insert advance warnings for a number of sound effects
          called for by the Folio stage directions (see Sound effects ); and (3) the
          absence of secondary cutting (contrast Smock Alley Macbeth, Hamlet, and
            Othello ). [10] Although none of these points is
          necessarily conclusive against stage production, the second being the strongest, taken
          together they leave the final status of the Lear PB to some degree at least
          questionable.   1. In any event, since only two London performances of Shakespeare's
            Lear , which was assigned to the Duke's Company in 1660, are recorded (1664/65
          and 1675) before Tate's 1681 adaptation and since Smock Alley tended to take its cue from
          London successes, it is probably unlikely that Lear would have been seriously
          considered for production before 1681.   2. In 1823 Edmund Kean reversed Colman's arrangement and tacked Shakespeare's
          tragic denouement (V.iii) onto a text that was basically pure Tate, including the
          Cordelia-Edgar love affair. For Kean's acting text, see Cumberland's British
            Theatre , Vol. VI (1826).   3. In Vol. VI: Part i, of this series, p. 4, note 19, I declared that the
          hands described as A and C (see the General Introduction, Vol. I: Part i, of this series,
          p. 17) were in fact a single hand. I have allowed this decision to stand, but I should
          warn the reader that I am no longer entirely convinced that Hands A and C should be
          treated as one.   4. See Vol. I: Part i, of this series, pp. 15-16. I there described Hand III

              remains of either 'drum / Colou&lt;rs&gt;' or 'souldie&lt;rs&gt;' (perhaps both were

              have preceded (as at IV.ii.59-61 and IV.vii.48-49) the advance call for Albany and
              Goneril at the bottom of F p. 783 and may, therefore, have been inserted as an
              afterthought by some hand other than Hand I. Hand I inserts no advance warnings for F sound effects called for at I.i.34 s.d.;

            that for 'Kent / Glouster / Edm:' in I.i, where the call is placed in the left margin
            opposite 3-5. Hand I omits calls for 'Attendants ' and 'Servants '
            called for by F stage directions except at II.iv.128, where '(ser)uants' is included in
            the advance call at 95. Point of entry is not marked (as, for example, by a crossed
            horizontal line in the Smock Alley Othello and Twelfth Night ). An
            advance call for 'Knight' is inserted at I.iv.14, following an advance call for
            'stew(ard)' at 8 above. Since the Steward (i.e., Oswald) enters at 48 and, after a
            half-line, exits, and the Knight's first speech comes at 54, he is presumably meant to
            enter immediately after the Steward's exit. It is possible, however, that Hand I
            intended the advance call to mark the Knight's reentry at 5: (as in edited texts since
            Dyce, who exits him at 51), thus treating the Knight as being among the
              'Attendants ' called for in the F s.d. at 7. The missing advance call for
            Edgar to enter at V. .37 was probably on the torn-off left corner of F p. 784. There is
            no advance call anticipating the F s.d. at the opening of V.ii, which brings Lear and
            Cordelia's army 'over the Stage, &amp; Exeunt.', although there is an advance
            call for Edgar and Gloucester, who enter immediately after this F s.d., at V.i.54 (but
            no call for Edgar's reentry at V.ii.4). Advance calls cease with V.ii. For the probable
            implications of this lack of further advance calls by Hand I, see the Introduction, p.

              made for metrical reasons. Tate, Kemble rewrite the whole scene.  22

              Of Hand II's comparatively few changes, all but one are unique to PB (see I.i.191) and
              are limited (except for the alteration of two speech-prefixes) to substituting
              commonplace words for words that by  the closing decades of the seventeenth century
              were considered either archaic or "hard." Hand III, from I.i through II.iv, frequently
              emends the F text by inserting, usually with a caret, (1) corrections of F's obvious
              errors (some of these small corrections may, indeed, be the work of Hand II); (2) a
              few short phrases from the Qq (first introduced into the basic F1 text by Pope); (3)
              other editorial emendations derived from the editions of Rowe (1709) through Jennens
              (1770); (4) a few adjustments of lineation and punctuation, also derived from
              eighteenth-century editions; and (5) a sizable number of emendations that are unique
              to Hand III (in addition to two [I.i.230; II.i.99] shared only with the Collier MS;
              see also Textual cuts, II.i.96, 125). Since there is no evidence to suggest
              that Hand III's doctoring of the text has any connection with PB's Smock Alley
              provenience, only the readings in category (5), and a few of special interest in
              categories (3) and (4), have been included in the following collation. I.i 112Hecate ] Hand III crosses through the final 'e ', reading

              Of Hand II's comparatively few changes, all but one are unique to PB (see I.i.191) and
              are limited (except for the alteration of two speech-prefixes) to substituting
              commonplace words for words that by  the closing decades of the seventeenth century
              were considered either archaic or "hard." Hand III, from I.i through II.iv, frequently
              emends the F text by inserting, usually with a caret, (1) corrections of F's obvious
              errors (some of these small corrections may, indeed, be the work of Hand II); (2) a
              few short phrases from the Qq (first introduced into the basic F1 text by Pope); (3)
              other editorial emendations derived from the editions of Rowe (1709) through Jennens
              (1770); (4) a few adjustments of lineation and punctuation, also derived from
              eighteenth-century editions; and (5) a sizable number of emendations that are unique
              to Hand III (in addition to two [I.i.230; II.i.99] shared only with the Collier MS;
              see also Textual cuts, II.i.96, 125). Since there is no evidence to suggest
              that Hand III's doctoring of the text has any connection with PB's Smock Alley

              categories (3) and (4), have been included in the following collation. </field><field name="file_s">ShaLeaP</field></doc><doc><field name="id">d1e1325</field><field name="slug_s">/bsuva/promptbook2013/</field><field name="project_s">Shakespearean Prompt-Books</field><field name="section_s">div2_1.1</field><field name="title_s">Shakespearean prompt-books of the seventeenth century, vol. 8  </field><field name="fulltext_t">I.i 112Hecate ] Hand III crosses through the final 'e ', reading
