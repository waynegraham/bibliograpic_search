                            49-91; Hull cuts 83-84; Gentleman (Bell, p. 125) says that "The
                                Abbess's mode of bringing Adriana to confess her spirit of
                            jealousy is well devised, and her corrective sentiments show great
                            sensibility, and liberality of heart."99-101 [line] / Wm Wall / [line]

                                line. The 'r' in Mr' is unusually formed
                            and there is some temptation to read 'Mrs' I am
                            nearly certain, however, that 'Mr' is the correct
                            reading. See the Introduction, p. 2 n., for further discussion.127 Song] Hand ?II. Another call, 'A Song:',
                            in the same hand, was first placed below 129 and then deleted. This does
                            not seem a very happy place at which to introduce a song; even the 1819
                            Covent Garden version which was produced with 'Songs, Duets, Glees, and
                            Chorusses', does not attempt to insert a song here.128 Gold. See . . . death] Crossed

                            call for Antipholus of Ephesus (Biggs) and Dromio of Ephesus (Coysh) at
                            189.168 Angelo:] Hand I prefixes 'Angelo:' as a
                            speech-head to this line; in F the speech belongs to the
                                'Messenger' who enters at this point, although no
                            speech-head appears in F. There are difficulties in PB's arrangement:
                            (1) the speech does not seem at all suitable to Angelo; (2) Angelo
                            (Wingfield) has been on stage since the beginning of the scene and
                            speaks at 123; (3) there is no call for Angelo's re-entry at 167. It is
                            possible, however, that the deletion of Angelo's speech at 128, in which
                            he says 'we will behold his death', may mean that he was supposed to
                            exit at this point and return at 167 in place of F's
                            'Messenger'; if this is so, the lack of a re-entry call is
                            unusual. Note that the Messenger's second speech is cut (180-184) .
                            Smock Alley PB and Hull preserve the 'Messenger'; Gentleman uses a

                            recapitulation of what has been transacted before the audience, deserves
                            omission, in that respect;  though
                            it is natural in Antipholis, to be very explicit to the Duke,
                            and a wronged person, in the warmth of complaint, is apt to dwell on
