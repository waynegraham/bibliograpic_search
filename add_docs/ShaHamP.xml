                                ] Possibly Hand II. As a prompt call this notation makes no
                            sense. Apparently something which has been trimmed away preceded the
                            last two names, but even before trimming there would not have been
                            enough room for actors' names. I.i.: Castle] Hand I. 1734, 1763, Garrick
                            PB, give the setting as 'An open place before the Palace.';
                            Ward A, 'Town:'; Ward B, 'a platform.' (these are the only suggestions
                            of actual settings in Ward A, B). 1703 Folger contains no descriptions
                            of settings, though the opening s.d. reads 'Enter Barnardo,
                            Francisco from the Castle.'1: Horatio / Marcellus] Hand II. Entry marked
                            with crossed line at 14. What looks like a small cross below this line
                            is an ink off-print from the facing page (731) .19-20: Ghost / Redy] Hands II, VII. Entry marked with crossed line at 39.30-31: Bar. Sit . . . And] Circled.
                                'Bar.' circled in error. Note that all later references to
                            sitting down (33, 70) are likewise circled for deletion. So Ward A, B,
                            1763, 1703 Folger, all of which substitute 'Come' (1734, although it
                            cuts the later references, retains 30-31) .32: so] Possibly crossed through, though the
                            deletion may be simply an ink off-print from the facing page (731).33-34: Hor. Well . . . And] Circled.
                                'Hor.' circled in error. Cut (retaining 'Well') 1734, Ward
                            A, B, 1763, and 1703 Folger.56: Before my God] Circled. Omitted Q6,
                            etc.59-60: Ghost / Redy] Hands II, VII. Entry marked with crossed line at 125.62-64: So fround . . . strange.] Circled. Cut
                            1734, Ward A, 1763; Q6, Ward B cut 62-63.63: Cock] Hand II. Call for the cock-crowing at
                            137 or 139; see below. Ward A, at 67, reads 'one to Crow'; Ward B, at
                            102, 'one / Ready to Crow'.70: Good now . . . and] Crossed through. Cut
                            1734, Ward A, B, 1763, Garrick PB, 1703 Folger (retaining Q 'Pray' for F
                            'Good now').72-80: So nightly . . . so:] Circled and
                            partly crossed through. There are several layers of
                                cutting here. 72-77, 78-79, 80 are separately circled.
                            Originally only 72-77 were included. Hand II finally gave the passage
                            its final form, crossing through 73-77, placing 'and' at the end of 72,
                            and deleting F 'Doth' in 78; at the same time altering 78 to read 'makes
                            the night joynt-laborouror with the day:' (the Qq
                            all omit 'Doth' and read 'makes'). Hand ?II has also written what looks
                            like 'for' before F 'Doth' (78), an addition deleted at the same time as
                            'Doth'. It is not clear whether 'At . . . so:' (80) is meant to be cut
                            in the final version of the lines (it has not been crossed through). See
                            the Introduction (p. 6) for a discussion of 'joynt-laborouror'. 1763 reads the speech as in the final form in
                            PB (cutting 'At . . . so:' 80); Q6, 1734 cut 73-79(' . . . me?'), 80
                            ('At . . . so.'); Ward A, B cut 73-77 (reading 'Making' 78), 80 ('At . .
                            . so.'); 1703 Folger cuts only 80 ('At . . . so.') .Image of prompt-book page 73183: (Thereto prick'd . . . prise) ] Circled and
                            crossed through. Cut Q6, etc. (except Garrick PB).85: (For so . . . him) ] Circled and crossed
                            through. A single vertical line after 'Combate.' (84) seems to join this
                            deletion with that in 83. Cut Q6, etc. (except Garrick PB) .90-96: Against the . . . full,] Circled and
                            crossed through (except for 'Now sir, young Fortinbras' 95).
                            Hand ?II has written 'and he' (deleted) opposite the end of 96,
                            intending to link 89 and 97. Later it was seen that the 'he' would thus
                            refer to the elder Fortinbras; 'and he' was cancelled and the last half
                            of 95 retained in its place, the other lines being crossed through.
                            1734, Ward, A, B as finally in PB; Q6 cuts 89-96; 1763 as in PB, but
                            retains 96.99-107: For food . . . Land.] Circled and
                            99-102 ('For . . . But'), 103 ('And termes compulsative,'), 106-107
                            crossed through. The original circling loses most of the point of the
                            speech. Q6 cuts 99-104 ('For . . . lost:') and 106-107; 1734, 1763, 1703
                            Folger cut as in PB, but also delete 'of . . . hand' (104); Ward A cuts
                            99-103 ('For . . . compulsa- tory,') and adds, as link, 'to recover';
                            Ward B cuts as in PB, but also deletes 'by strong hand' (102) .137, 139: Croe / Crow] Hands ?III, ?VIII. Q6,
                            etc., following 138 note 'The Cock crows.' (cancelled in

                                Redy] Hand II ('Redy' Hand VII). Entry marked with crossed
                            line at opening of scene ii. Note that, like Q6, 1734, Ward A, 1763,
                            Garrick PB, 1703 Folger, PB omits Ophelia from those entering in scene
                            ii (the name is not deleted in PB's F s.d.); Ward B adds Ophelia to the
                            quarto entry.158-165: Some sayes . . . it,] Circled and
                            crossed through. 'Hor:' added at beginning of
                                166. Q6 cuts 155, ('and . . . ') 156, 158-165; 1734, Ward A,

                            calls for the change of scene at scene ii below. It is used regularly in
                            this PB, except at the end of acts; it is used nowhere else in the Smock

                            crossed through. The original rough circling of these lines (17
                            excepted) left the speech dangling. Hand II crossed through the last
                            half of 17 ('you . . . Fortinbras,'), and substituted, in the
                            right margin, preceded with a small cross, 'we have ['have' smeared
                                or deleted] disp&lt;atch'd&gt; / Embassadours &lt;?to&gt; /
                            young Fortin&lt;bras&gt; / And now La&lt;ertes&gt; [the last three
                                words deleted]'. He then crossed through 18-35, deleted F 'to
                            you' (36), interlining 'them' above, inserted 'of Treaty' (something
                            cancelled after 'of') following F 'power' (36), and deleted F 'To
                            businesse' and  'more' in 37. He
                            finally crossed through 39-41 (including the s.d.). Hand V is
                            responsible for the speech-heads 'Pol:' before 36 and 'King', affixed
                            with a caret above the beginning of 42. It is possible that the changes
                            in 36 are also Hand V's work. Some reference to the 'Ambassadours' is
                            preserved by Hand II to prepare for the report of their return in II.ii.
                            40-41, but why three of the King's lines (36-38) are given to Polonius
                            is not very clear. Originally Hand II intended to cut everything down to
                            42 (see the cancelled 'And now La&lt;ertes&gt;' above). Note also that
                            the 'Ambassadours' have been sent to 'young Fortin&lt;bras&gt;' instead
                            of to 'old Norway'. Q6 cuts 17-41 ('Now . . . farewell.'); 1734
                            seems to cut 17-50; Ward A cuts 16-41 ('for . . . farewell.'), linking
                            with 'And' and including 'what's . . . you?' in 42; Ward B, 63 cut 16-41
                            ('for . . . farewell.'); 1703 Folger cuts 17 ('Now . . . farewell.') and
                            links with 'And' to 42.Image of prompt-book page 73243-50: What is't . . . Laertes?]
                            Circled (except 43) and crossed through (except 50). Hand II thus
                            exchanges 50 for 43. Q6, Ward A, B, 1763 cut 44-50; 1734 cuts, 17-50;

                            above deleted 'my' in both cases. The change misses the intentionally
                            personal quality of Claudius' approach to Hamlet.77-81: my Inky . . . Visage,] Crossed through.
                            Hand 1I substitutes 'these / mourning weeds'. Q6 cuts 78-81 (reading

                            crossed through, probably by Hand II. Hand I has placed 'Chamber' (badly
                            smudged in cancelling) below F 'Actus Secundus.'1-74: Enter Polonius . . . Farewell:]
                            Circled and crisscrossed through (except 74). Hand V
                                begins the second act with 74('Polon. Farewell:'), drawing a heavy line under 73,
                            criss-crossing 1-73, and emending F s.d. 'Enter Ophelia.' to
                                'Act 2d. Enter
                                Ophelia. meeting Polonius.'. In the right margin, opposite
                            75-78, Hand II notes 'Act 2d. / begins &lt;here&gt;'
                            and 'Bed' (Hand questionable) is added above Hand I's 'Cham&lt;ber&gt;'
                            (repeated here by Hand I after cancellation at the beginning of the F
                            scene). Hand VII adds another 'Act &lt;2&gt;' opposite 73 in the margin.
                            The arrangement here arrived at by Hand II leaves Polonius with a rather
                            pointless 'Farewell:' to a Reynaldo who does not appear. Although the
                            arrangement is possible, it seems most likely that Hand II intended to
                            include 'Farewell:' in the cut. Q6, etc. (except Garrick PB) cut 1-74
                            ('. . . Farewell.'). Collier MS cuts 24-37 ('As . . . that.') . Both
                            Garrick PB and 1703 Folger begin Act III with this scene. Ward A, B,
                            1763 adapt the Q or F std. and read 'Enter Ophelia. meeting

                                B]. 1734, 1763, Garrick PB give the setting as 'An

                            (crossed through). Q6, etc. (except 1763) read 'loose' (see 80,
                            below).80: and down-gyved to his Ancle,] Crossed
                            through ('and' and 'gyved' lightly circled in red pencil) . In terms of
                            the circling, the line would have read 'Ungarter'd, down to his Ancle,'.
                            Q6, Ward B, 1703 Folger cut 80; 1734 cuts 78 ('with his Doublet,'),

                            PB; 1763 cuts 82-84 ('in . . . horrors:'); 1703 Folger cuts 'from

                            from the F s.d.'s vague 'cum aliis' at II.ii. I have
                            reconstructed 'Rosinc&lt;ras&gt;' and 'Guilde&lt;nsterne&gt;' from the
                            forms usually used by Hand II.84: he] Crossed through. Cut 1703 Folger.87: wrist, &amp; held me hard] Hand IV adds

                            included in Q6, etc. This is the first appearance in this PB of an
                            eighteenth century hand which makes similar additions and corrections in
                                Lear, Twelfth Night, and Merry Wives.96: he let me go] Hand II crosses through 's'
                            in F 'lets' and 'go' and adds 'me go' at end of line. 'me' is omitted in
                            Ff 2-4; Q6, etc. read 'he lets me go,'.103-107: Whose violent . . . What]Crossed through. Cut 1734, 1763; Q6, Ward A,

                            it) at the beginning of 11, leaving 6-9 as part of the text. 9-13 would
                            thus read 'So much from th' understanding of himself, / I know not /

                            cut 5-7 ('so . . . was;'), 8-9 ('that himself,'), 11-12.15-18: and to . . . remedy,] Another confused
                            passage. 15-18 are crossed through. Hand II interlines above deleted
                            portion of 15 '&amp; to gather if ought'; then with a cross above
                            'ought' continues in the left margin with '&lt;unk&gt;nowne /
                            afflic&lt;ts&gt; him / &lt;t&gt;hat lies / &lt;wth
                            in&gt; &lt;o&gt;ur remedy.' This at least seems to be Hand II's final
                            version. Before this, however, perhaps another Hand (though it looks
                            very much like Hand II again) had written 'if ought' after F 'gather' in
                            15 (crossed through along with the end of 15); then between 'him' and
                            '&lt;t&gt;hat' in the left margin presumably the same hand (Hand II)
                            wrote (later deleted) what looks like '&lt; &gt; wth
                            in / &lt; &gt; &lt;rem&gt;edy. whch' (the last word,
                            of which the reading is uncertain, not being deleted). To add further
                            confusion Hand IV has interlined above the deleted 18 'to us unknown
                            afflicts him thus'. 17 is missing from Ff and Hand II has obviously
                            tried to introduce a form of the Q line 'Whether ought to us unknown
                            afflicts him thus, / That lies within our remedy.' 1734 cuts 15-16
                            ('gather. . . may'); Ward A cuts 16 and reads 'learn' for 'gather

                            meant to reproduce the sidenote in Q6 which marks the lines as 'Letter.'

                            of the 'Letter', is either to indicate the lines as material to be read
                            or simply to call attention to the introduction of the 'Letter'. Both

                            crossed through, but this is the result of an ink showthrough from p.
                            740. None of the later versions cuts these lines, except Ward A which
                            deletes the first half of 149 (part of a cut beginning with 147 ['then .

                            through. Because of the loss of the left corner of the page, the
                            conclusion of the cut is uncertain, PB taking up again with 'deale
                            justly . . . ' (284-85). Q6, Ward A, B, 1703 Folger omit 244-276 ('Let .

                            MS cuts 263-272 ('. . . Shadowes:'). It seems likely, therefore, that PB
                            also ended its cut with 276 (' . . . attended;'). The final intention in
                            PB is somewhat confused: a single vertical line has been drawn down the
                            center of the column from 231 to the point at which the tear begins
                            (this would seem to imply a cancellation of everything from 231 through
                            ?276); also at one time it was intended to include 'but your newes is
                            not true.' (243-244) as part of the original circled cut.267-284: ] These lines are missing as a result
                            of the loss of the lower left corner of p. 740 (sig. 3R1v). Q6, etc. cut 281-282 ('and . . . half-peny:'). 1703 Folger

                            later Qq) confuse the issue by inserting 'So proceed.' as the conclusion
                            of Polonius' speech (488-489). The confusion was the result of the
                            cutting of 486 in the Betterton version (Q6), the 'So proceed.' at the
                            conclusion of Polonius' speech being intended for Hamlet. The PB reading
                            is a conflation of the two Q readings. 1734, Ward B, 1763 follow the
                            arrangement in PB, but read Hamlet's line as 'So proceed you.'; Ward A,

                            includes 574 ('Ros. Farewel, my Lord.'), a version of the F and
                            Q line 'Rosin. Good my Lord.' which appears first in the 1734
                            cutting (a version also appearing in Ward A, B, 1763, 1703 Folger); 1703
                            Folger cuts as in PB, but (as in 
                            1763 also) it transposes 572-574 ('My . . . Lord.') to follow 563 ('. .

                            Q6, however, reads 'the motive, and that for passion / That I have?' and
                            I suspect that Hand II intended to follow Q6; however, Hand II's reading
                            makes possible sense and is not much more awkward than Q6's. 1734, 1763,

                            the left margin opposite 35, and another small reference cross follows
                            'this' in Hand II's version. Note that Hand II's call for 'Hamlet',
                            which originally followed 35, has been deleted, presumably in the
                            process of adding the alteration. As a result there is no call for
                            Hamlet's entry at 56 below. Q6, 1734, Ward A, B cut 35, 37.44-54: Read on . . . burthen!] Circled and

                            stages). Apparently only 50-53 were finally cut, though Q6 (followed by
                            1734, Ward A, B, 1763, 1703 Folger) cut the lines as circled in PB (Ward

                            does not follow Q6 (and all later versions) in reading 43-44 ('Gracious

                            that the blotting is the result of a deletion on the facing page [745]);
                            at any rate, in the same light ink as the circling of 166-167, some hand
                            has written a word in the left margin opposite 165, the last letters of

                            what may have been cut, though probably nothing in the second group of
                            lines. All the acting versions use Q6's version of 73-79 (except 1763
                            and 1703 Folger which cut everything in the scene after 72, thus
                            omitting Hamlet's soliloquy entirely); 1734 cuts 80 ('full of Bread,');
                            it is worth noting that PB cuts nothing in the last part of Hamlet's

                            that for Hamlet and Rosencrantz at 3-5 above are separated, they are, I
                            believe, part of the same call, indicating that Hamlet entered at 17
                            under the guard of 'Officers' (as 14 suggests) . There is nothing in the
                            Ff s.d.'s to indicate this; the Qq have 'They enter.' at 16, which,
                            since Guildenstern is already entered as part of 'all the rest'
                            at 10, implies attendants of some kind. Ward A, B call the 'Officers'
                            'Attendants'; 1734, 1763, 'Guards'. Edited texts all leave the
                            'business' here to 'Attendants' (when they list anyone as entering with
                            Hamlet and Guildenstern); the police effect of the 'Officers' preserves
                            a detail of the seventeenth-century stage effect otherwise lost, an
                            interpretation of the situation which apparently carried over into the
                            eighteenth century.22-23: Your worm . . . Beggar.] Circled and

                            Garrick PB and 1703 Folger cut out Fortinbras along with 1-8, but they
                            include substantially all the remainder of the scene, substituting
                            Guildenstern for the Q Captain (1703 Folger reverses the roles and
                            substitutes Rosencrans for the Captain; see a full account of the

                            margin, PB shows the remains of what may again (see 93 above) be a call
                            for Laertes by Hand II. However, it is possible that both these
                            illegible calls have reference to offstage 'noise' heralding Laertes'

                            Circled and crisscrossed. Cut Q6, etc. This common cut gets rid of an
                            ambiguity in the Queen's attitude at this point.113-114: ] PB has a small star placed in left
                            margin opposite the first part of 113 and below, in Hand ?II, two only
                            partly legible words '&lt; &gt;er' and '&lt; &gt;se'. The first word may
                            possibly be 'Enter' and the second an actor's name (though I can connect
                            what remains with no actor at Smock Alley at this time); if so, then the
                            star probably marks actual point of entry for Laertes (despite the
                            crossed line marking his entry at 111) . If we accept this
                            interpretation, it raises difficulties with my later identification of
                            Williams as Laertes (see V.ii.153). Another explanation may be that the
                            two words should be read as 'her noise' and that the star indicates the
                            point for the noise (this would link the star with the one above at
                            98).123-125: Divinity about a king / That treason
                            can but offer at wt. / it would. / Tell me
                                Laertes, Only 125 is circled; Hand II substitutes 'about',
                            point of insertion marked with a cross, for F 'cloth hedge' (deleted)
                            and 'offer at wt. / it would.' for F 'peep . . .

                                Laertes,') was thus meant to be retained. Q6 reads
                            'divinity cloth hedge a King, / That treason dares not reach at what it
                            would, / Acts little of his will: tell me Laertes'; 1734, Ward A, 1763

                            read 'will' for F 'comes' (1747 reads 'will' and omits F 'only', both
                            corrected by Garrick).139-143: Good Laertes: will you in revenge /
                                Of your dear father's death, destroy both friend and foe,]
                            Hand II inserts 'will you in revenge' after F 'Laertes:',
                            crosses through 140-141  ('If . . .
                            draw'), and interlines 'destroy' above F 'draw' with a caret; 'Good
                                Laertes:' and 143 ('Winner and looser.') are circled (143
                            also crossed through) . It would appear then that 'Good
                                Laertes:' was not included in the cut, but it should be
                            noticed that Q6, which reads the lines as in PB, omits 'Good
                                Laertes:'. The later versions all follow Q6. Collier MS
                            cuts 139-147 ('Good . . . that?').147-148: you speake / Like a true] Hand II
                            inserts 'you speake' after F 'that?' (147), deleting F 'what noise is
                            that?' and interlines 'a' before F 'true' (148), deleting F 'a good
                            child, and a'; Hand ?II had earlier inserted 'you speak' above 'noise
                            that?', marking point of insertion with a cross before 'what', but
                            deleted it. Q6 (and F') read 'you speak / Like a good child, and a
                            true', followed by 1734, Garrick PB; Ward A, B, 1763, 1703 Folger read
                            as in PB. 151: clearly to your Judgement shew] Hand II
                            interlines 'clearly' above F 'level' (deleted) and inserts 'shew' after
                            F 'pierce' (deleted) . Q6, etc. read 'lye' for 'pierce', except Garrick
                            PB.152: ] Following F 'eye.', PB has what looks
                            like 'Call Op', later deleted, (Hand ?II). Either Hand ?II began to add
                            'Call Ophelia.' to the end of the King's line or the notation was meant
                            to indicate calls of 'Ophelia' as part of F 'A noise within.'.
                            In this connection, it is significant that 1734 adds, after the King's
                            speech 'Within. O poor Ophelia.', so, perhaps, what
                            Hand ?II started to write was 'Call O p'. Ward A adds 'poor Ophelia!' to
                            the end of the King's speech; 1763 gives 'O poor Ophelia!' to Horatio
                                'Within.'; and Garrick PB transfers the words to Laertes,
                            adding 'My' before 'poor'. Something like 'Op' has been faintly written
                            in below the F s.d. 'within.'.154-155: Oh heat . . . eye.] Circled. Q6 cuts

                            inserted 'may', with a caret, above F 'call'.172: Oh, how . . . become?] Lightly circled.
                            Some Hand, perhaps II, has written what looks like '&lt;t&gt;hat', the
                            initial 't' being lost in the F '?', after 'become?', probably in an
                            attempt to make sense of the F3 reading. Whether a cut was finally
                            intended here is not clear. Ward B cuts 'Oh . . . becomes it,'.174-180: ] A tear in the PB has been mended by
                            a piece of paper pasted over the last half of these lines; nothing,
                            however, seems to suggest any cutting.194-196: Horatio / Servant / Redy] Hand II
                            ('Redy' Hand VII). Point of entry marked with crossed line at

                            cutting is not clear: 'Gramercy' is crossed through, and
                            apparently 'on', but 'his' and 'Soul' are
                            barely touched. The difficulty lies in PB's retention of 'And of all
                            Christian Soules' in the line below, which makes no sense without some
                            version of 199's reference to 'Soul'. Q6, etc. read (for
                            199-200) 'And peace be with his soul and with all Lovers souls.'.200-201: I pray . . . gods?] Circled

                            actor David Williams) see, Introduction, p. 1. So far as '&lt; &gt;ne'
                            is concerned (the last letter being doubtful),
                             although it may well be an actor's
                            name, I can only hazard two guesses. There was a Mrs. Kaine who appeared
                            in the Smock Alley Henry VIII as an Old Lady and it is possible
                            that the fop Osric was played by a woman (though not in the London
                            Betterton production) . As I noted at 61-62 above, an illegible word
                            appears to follow Osric's name in the call and it is tempting to read
                            the first letter of that word as 'K' and to read, here, '&lt;Kai&gt;ne'.
                            There may, of course, have been a 'Mr. Kaine' as well as a 'Mrs. Kaine',
                            but I know of no evidence for such an actor. Clark (Early lrish
                                Stage, p. 208) lists a 'Mr. Kaine', but, as I have explained in
                            the General Introduction (p. 14, n.29), this listing arises from a
                            misinterpretation. Alternatively, the call may stand for '&lt;wi&gt;ne'
                            (cf. Ward A: 'King / Queen / Laertes / Attendants / a /Flourish / [line]
                            / one with a / cup of wine').190-197: ] What remains of Hand II's call
                            (apparently scrawled over) for King, Queen, Laertes, etc. can be seen
                            opposite these lines. It may be reconstructed as '&lt;King&gt; /
                            &lt;Queen&gt;e / &lt;Laerte&gt;s / &lt;Attend&gt;ants /

                            deletion of 'Towne' and the substitution of 'new sceen' by Hand VIII at
                            the beginning of V.ii make a change of scene here unnecessary. That some
                            kind of a discovery at this point is intended in PB is clear; Q6, Ward B
                            indicate no change; 1734, 1763 read 'Scene draws, and discovers
                                King, Queen, Laertes, Gentlemen and Guards.'; Ward A
                            alters Q6 s.d. to read 'Discover'd Officers with cushions, King, Queen, and Ostrick, Foils,
                                and Laertes.'.251: Sir, in this Audience,] Marked with

                            . time,' [261] not circled but crossed through in red pencil). Cut Q6,
                            etc.278: stoops of Wine upon the Table:] Hand II
                            crosses through F 'the Stopes of', interlining 'stoops of' with a caret
                            before 'the', and F 'that', writing 'the' above. Q6, 1734, Ward B read
                            as in F, except for 'the' for 'that'; Ward A reduces to 'Give me the
                            wine.' (having deleted 'ATable prepared,' at 236 s.d.); 1763 reduces to 'Give me a Bowl
                            of Wine.'.283: Onix] Hand ?II alters F 'Union' to
                            'Onix'. So Q6, etc.Image of prompt-book page 759291: Sound] Hand VI. Q6, 1734, Ward B, 1763
                            read 'Trumpets the while.'; Ward A adds 'Flourish'.294: wine] Hand II crosses through F 'Cup' and
                            substitutes 'wine' following.296-297: What say . . . touch,] Circled. Q6,
                            etc. cut 297 ('A touch, a touch,').322: Villan] Some Hand deletes the 'y' on F
                            'Villany'. So Q6, 1734.324: Hamlet,] Crossed through.
                            Omitted Q6, etc.329: ] What appears to be some alteration in F

                            VII); 'Red&lt;y&gt;' has been badly smeared, perhaps deleted. Although
                            PB appears to omit 'Colours' as called for in the F s.d. at
                            372, it is possible that something of the sort originally followed PB's
                            'Drum'.360: shout / drum] Hands VI, III. Note that
                            Hand VI's 'shout' is not anticipative and that Hand III's 'drum'
                            essentially repeats Hand VI's advance call at 333-335 and Hand II's
                            immediately beside it.375: His quarry . . . Havock.] Crossed
