                            Although PB does not cancel the F scene iii break at 119, as do modern
                            texts since Rowe, it obviously runs the two scenes together by bringing
                            the Provost, etc. on 4 lines earlier. It also makes another change in
                            the entry of Lucio and the Gentlemen who (see below) are brought on
                            separately just before Lucio's first speech at 128 (this in spite of the
                            fact that Lucio and `Gent' were included in the prompter's call at 114).
                            D'Avenant, Tonson, Bell, and Inchbald enter Lucio as in PB, though

                            Originally 61 seems to have been the extent of the cut; an `I' was

                            he retains the earlier `prenzie, Angelo' (94). D'Avenant
                            completely rewrites, getting rid of `prenzie gardes' and converting
                            `prenzie Angelo' to `Princely Angelo' (the reading of F2,
                            etc.); Tonson does not cut but uses `Princely' in 94 and 97; Bell cuts
                            as in PB and uses `princely' in 94; Inchbald does not cut but reads
                            `priestly' (Hanmer) for `prenzie' in 94 and 97. 140-143 What should . . . blood.] Circled.
                            D'Avenant cuts the whole speech, for which there is no need since
                            Claudio has obliged by dissolving in sentiment just before. Bell retains
                            the lines, but a note by Gentleman (p. 311) suggests they "had better be
                            left out, as blemishing the chaste ideas of Isabella,
                            particularly that insinuation of a mother's frailty" (he includes the
                            preceding line also); Inchbald cuts as in PB; Tonson cuts only 136 (`O
                            you Beast!'). Image of prompt-book page 72151-152 [line] / Duke / [line] ] Call for
                            re-entry of Duke at 152, not marked in F (added F2, etc.). Note that PB,
                            like F (added F2, etc.) fails to notice the Duke's and Provost's exit
                            earlier at 53. 161 ff.] Beginning with this line PB has what appears to be a name scrawled three
                                times down the left margin (the last two
                                attempts badly smudged). I read the scribble as follows: `B
                            ffor t t t joh: B john B'. The series `t t t' is questionable, possibly
                            the first `t' should be read as `j'; the last `t' might be almost
                            anything. `B ffor t' may be some kind of shortened form for `Beaufort'.
                            No John Beaufort appears to be linked in any way with Sir Edward Dering.
                            The name seems to have no immediate connection with the prompt-book as
                            such and may have been written in later. The hand is certainly not that
                            of the reviser-prompter in either Macbeth or Measure for
                                Measure, nor is it the same as the prompt-hand in Winter's
                                Tale. 177] PB, like Ff, fails to bring the Provost
                            back at this point, though F2, etc. includes him in the Duke's exit at
                            53. D'Avenant does not reintroduce him; Tonson and Bell bring him on
                            with the Duke at 152 (following Rowe); Inchbald introduces him after 177
                            (following Capell). Collier MS fails to re-enter the Provost.184-188 The hand . . . that] Circled, though
                            probably `the assault that' (188) was not meant to be included in the

                            because of the long deletion beginning at 43, thus giving Lucio time to
                            get well on stage before his first line at 90. 43-89 Clo. I spy . . . goe:] Bracketed, 43 separately. See

                            confusing, but it seems likely that 276 was meant to be retained, giving
                            the Duke an exit line. See Introduction, p. oo, for further comment. 276-278 [line] / Song / [line] ] This is a

                            not in Ff, occurs here rather than at 83 because 84-86 were cut after
                            `Knock' had been inserted. Note that PB has no such warning at 72 above
                            and that the warning here seems early (for this PB) since the Duke only
                            mentions the noise as apparently beginning again at 91. We may note,
                            however, that Rowe, who first introduced the s.d.'s, also placed the
                            second one here instead of at 91 (also in Tonson and Bell, the second of
                            which omits the `knocking' at 72, cutting the reference to `noise').
                            Inchbald has the `knocking' at 72 and 86, but cuts the reference to
                            `noise' in 91; part of the general cut in D'Avenant. Note that PB, as in
                            Ff, makes no allowance for the Provost's exit (88) and re-entry (92). 102-103 [line] / Seruant / [line] ] PB

                            general cutting in D'Avenant. The PB reviser would not seem to agree
                            with Gentleman (Bell, p. 327): "This short break, in the Duke's speech,
                            is very beautiful; it is a well-timed relief to, and pleasing
                            gratification of, attention." </field><field name="file_s">ShaMeaP</field></doc><doc><field name="id">d1e1167</field><field name="slug_s">/bsuva/promptbook2013/</field><field name="project_s">Shakespearean Prompt-Books</field><field name="section_s">div2_4.3</field><field name="title_s">Shakespearean prompt-books of the seventeenth century, vol. 2 (Padua

                            in the major roles (Duke, Isabella, Angelo); this suggests, what earlier
                            evidence seems to support, that the reviser is as much (or more)
                            interested in reducing the length of the principal roles as in
