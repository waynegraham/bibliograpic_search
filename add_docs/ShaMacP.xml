                            written and then crossed through. PB marks no new scene setting; Bell no
                            new scene (after Rowe); Lee indicates 'a hall' (but this was
                            the setting of the preceding scene); Lee-Salmon PB adds 'Door OP Shut'
                            and below 'Time giuen.'.1-46] The order of cutting and restoration in
                            these lines is uncertain. In what seems to be the final form, 5 ('Here's
                            . . . ' )-23 and 28 ('of three . . . ')-46 were cut. Judging by the inks
                            used, Hand II first deletes, by circling, the whole of 1-46, then
                            changes his mind and marks both circled sections with 'stet' and
                            'stett'. Hand III then crisscrosses 5-23 and 28-46 for deletion, adding
                            'to sle&lt;ep&gt;' at the end of 27 to complete the sense. Hand IV
                            tidies things up by placing an advance call for Macduff and Ross at
                            II.ii.52 (deleting Hand II's call at the beginning of scene iii) and an
                            advance call for Macbeth at II.ii.74. Apparently Hand II neglected to
                            mark an advance call for Macbeth; however, see above, II.iii (opening).
                            The order of events as here described presents certain problems, but I
                            am unable to offer any more satisfactory alternative. Padua PB cuts the
                            whole of the Porter's soliloquy; D'Avenant also cuts the soliloquy,
                            reduces the Porter's role to one line (he, here called Servant, and
                            Lennox enter together and after three lines Macduff enters), and
                            replaces 23-46 with eleven lines 
                            between Lennox and Macduff based on F lines 59-66; Douai MS reduces the
                            Porter's soliloquy to 'P: here's a knocking indeed: who's there in the
                            name of belzebub? anon; anon; I am coming. (Opens the doore.)' and omits
                            27-46 ('and drink . . . him.'); Bell cuts everything down to Macduff's
                            entry (24), the Servant, who has opened the 'door' to Macduff
                            and Lennox, being given F 26-27 ('Faith . . . cock:'), and then adds
                            Lennox's speech from F (59-66). These last two speeches are in italics,
                            and Gentleman (Bell) remarks: ". . . and the Italic lines, by
                            transposition, judiciously introduced to give Macbeth time for
                            change of appearance, of which, even now, he is allowed too little.";
                            Lee cuts the Porter's soliloquy, bringing Lennox on alone (Lee-Salmon PB
                            notes 'PS' ), 'who knocks at the chamber door several times pretty
                                hard, then a servant opens it.' (Lee-Salmon PB adds 'OP'),
                            follows D'Avenant's opening two speeches, inserts F 47 ('Is . . .
                            stirring?'), and adds: 'Serv. Not yet, Sir, but he'll scarce
                            lye late; he's of an active spirit, that never suffers his body to lye

                            leisure. / Serv. I will, Sir.' Collier MS shows points of
                            resemblance to Smock Alley PB, since it cuts lines 5-22 ('Here's . . .
                            Bonfire.'), 27-46 ( 'And Drink . . . him.').23 s.d. Enter Macduff, and Rosse [Hand

                            then Hand III deletes Hand II's 'Rosse' and writes 'and Rosse' above the
                            deleted F 'and Lenox.'; finally, Hand III writes 'and
                            Ro&lt;sse&gt;' following the deleted 'Rosse' by Hand II (the order of
                            Hand III's changes may, of course, have been reversed).28 to sle&lt;ep&gt;] Hand III substitutes 'to

                            through but not reassigned. Presumably Hand II deleted it but failed to
                            give it to Ross, who takes Lennox's place in the scene. Lennox's
                            speech-prefixes otherwise remain untouched in this scene, though his
                            speeches must have been spoken by Ross.76 Macd.] Some hand has altered F
                                'b' in 'Macb.' to 'd', thus restoring the

                            'Rosse' neglected to cancel the advance call for his re entry at 85.
                            Despite  this oversight, I suspect
                            that he is not intended to exit with Macbeth at this point but remains
                            on stage to speak Lennox's speech (106-111).79 Banquo] Hand II.83-85 Macbeth / &lt;R&gt;osse] Hand II.88-89 &lt;Ma&gt;lcolme / &lt;Don&gt;albine]

                            preceding deletion together, one notes that D'Avenant also omits these
                            lines (and a good many others) and works part of 133-135 ('let . . .
                            further.') into a speech by Macbeth a few lines later. In Bell and Lee,
                            Lady Macbeth does not appear in the scene at all, apparently a
                            long-standing practice (G. W. Stone, SP, XXXVIII [1941],
                            621-22); except for references to Lady Macbeth, Lee preserves 131-138
                            essentially intact, but Bell omits 132-133 ('And . . . exposure:') as in

                                (PMLA, LVI [1941], 375 n., 377-78) explains the change of
                            setting from 'Towne' to 'Rock' as the result of what seems to be an

                            and suggests that "at least one" of D'Avenant's witch songs was here
                            used (see below, 10-13, 21). Of the two witch
                             songs (D'Avenant, II.v) probably
                            the second is the more likely choice, since it alone is followed by a
                            dance in D'Avenant's version (the first sixteen lines of the song also
                            appeared in the 1673 quarto of Macbeth, interpolated between
                            scenes iii and iv, which is otherwise substantially a reprint of F1).
                            The substitution of Banquo for the Old Man in PB may also perhaps be
                            explained by the importation of the Witches, since their song might seem
                            more suitable for Banquo's ears, though it should be noted that the
                            directions implying the Witches are in Hand IV. In D'Avenant the scene
                            is carried by Lennox and Seyton, down to Macduff's entrance; nor do the
                            witch songs appear in this scene. They are part of the following scene
                            (II.v), a scene ('An Heath.') almost entirely D'Avenant's own
                            creation, and are directed at Macduff and Lady Macduff. Bell, Lee retain
                            Shakespeare's scene with Ross and the Old Man, but place it at the
                            beginning of Act III, inserting a scene with all the Witch business, but
                            minus the Macduffs, from D'Avenant II.v. Bell, Lee-Salmon PB exit the
                            Old Man just before Macduff's entry. Clearly PB, Bell, Lee have one aim
                            in mind: entertainment at any cost. Lee gives no scene setting; in Bell

                            untouched. The D'Avenant Yale MS substitutes 'Three score and one' for F
                            'Threescore and ten', but the printed text cuts the whole phrase and
                            begins 'I can remember well,' thus better adapting the following lines

                            this date depends, I assume, on dating the Macbeth PB somewhat
                            earlier than I believe likely. See Introduction, p. 2. Farlow here plays
                            the Servant, and the position of the advance call at 22 suggests that he
                            was intended to enter about 44 (as in the Padua PB); editors, from Rowe
                            on (followed by Bell, Lee), assume the Servant to be one of the F

                            turns the interview into one between Seyton and Macbeth, in which, with

                            and writes 'two' above. This scene has been radically cut about by Hand
                            III, largely to bring it into line with D'Avenant's version. Originally
                            the scene was planned as written; Hand II's calls for 'Murtherers' at
                            III.ii.44 and 'Banquo / ffleans' at the beginning of scene iii indicate
                            this (though the number of the 'Murtherers' is ambiguous). As Hand III
                            sets the scene up, Banquo and Fleance cross the stage first and are
                            immediately followed by the 'two' Murderers, whose dialogue has been
                            considerably cut to resemble D'Avenant's. The Murderers follow Banquo
                            and Fleance off-stage and the scene ends. R. C. Bald (PMLA, LVI
                            [1941], 377) is surely mistaken when he says "it is interesting to note
                            that, while Davenant makes the actual murder occur off-stage, in the
                            Dublin version Banquo and Fleance do not even come on beforehand." In
                            D'Avenant the three Murderers enter first, speak nine lines, and exit;
                            then Banquo and Fleance enter, speak five lines, and exit; the Murderers
                            re-enter, speak four lines, and go out after Banquo and Fleance;
                            finally, Fleance, pursued by the Murderers, re-enters on the run and
                            throws a single line at the audience. Bell follows F1 (though with some
                            cutting) down to 18 (' . . . Slave!') and cuts the remainder of the
                            Murderers' lines; Banquo dies on stage. Lee follows a heavily cut
                            version of F1 down to the entrance of Banquo and Fleance and turns to
                            D'Avenant for their speeches; after their exit, the Murderers (First and
                            Second) are given an original line each and then pursue Banquo and
                            Fleance off-stage; finally, Fleance re-enters to deliver D'Avenant's

                            horse way is'; at this point he apparently planned to keep the rest of
                            the speech as it was, only inserting 'usually' after F 'Gate', but he
                            changes his mind, deletes 'usually' and F 'it' (14), interlining 'this'
                            above, deletes F 'walk.', and inserts 'usuall walke' following. He then

                            undeleted. As a result of the crowding of Hand III's first changes, his
                            intention is not clear, and it is possible that he meant the first line
                            to read '1. the horse way is / almost a mile: about'. Lines 14-22 are
                            circled and x'd through, though perhaps Hand III's 'come Lets away' was

                                Witches'. As a rule, however, the prompter does not bother to
                            call for non-speaking characters, and the s.d. in F remains uncut. Padua
                            PB has no call for Hecate or 'the other three Witches', but it
                            does not cancel the F s.d. at 38, nor does it reassign Hecate's speech
                            at 39. D'Avenant, who went in for all the witches he could get, retains
                            the three extra witches, as do Douai MS and Bell. Lee goes even further,
                            reading the s.d. at 38 as 'Enter Hecate and all the singing
                                Witches.' and assigning the parts of the song in D'Avenant's
                            version specifically to the 'singing Witches'. D'Avenant (also in the
                            Yale MS) assigns the last part only of 61 to a fourth witch, but the
                            context makes it clear that he really means Hecate; Douai MS, Bell, Lee

                            lines are also cut, Hecate's role is enlarged, and the Apparitions are
                            entirely cut out. The scene was originally planned
                             by Hand II to include the
                            Apparitions (see above 55-56). Bell, Lee retain the Apparitions; the

                            '&lt;Ser&gt;vant' is impossible to determine, though one would expect it
                            to be either Hand III or Hand IV, probably Hand III, though the 'r' form
                            employed is closer to Hand IV's. The ink, however, is much darker than
                            that in 'here', which, nevertheless, does not seem to be quite the same
                            as in Hand IV's call at 107-109. F 'Lenox' has been crossed

                            phrase 'her son' seems to have been crossed through (Hand ?II); see

                            Originally the scene was planned by Hand II to include the little boy,
                            as well as the dialogue between mother and son (30-64) and the later
                            dialogue of the Murderers (79 ('Where . . .' )-85), passages also
                            omitted by D'Avenant. D'Avenant substitutes Lennox for Ross; Douai MS
                            makes an unusual number of short cuts in this scene; Bell cuts
                            essentially as in PB but retains the entry of the son; Lee omits the
                            whole scene. Gentleman (Bell) comments on this scene: "Here
                                Shakespeare, as if the vigorous exertion of his faculties,
                            in the preceding scene, required relaxation, has given us a most
                            trifling superfluous dialogue, between Lady Macduff,
                                Rosse, and her son, merely that another murder may be
                            committed, on the stage too. We heartily concur in, and approve of,
                            striking out the greatest part of it." In the second edition (1774), he
                            drops this note but adds: "The character of Lady Macduff, and
                            consequently this scene, is entirely omitted, at some theatres, as
                            unnecessary to representation, the fatal catastrophe of the family being
                            finely introduced in another part of this act."25-26 My pretty . . . you.] Crossed through by
                            Hand III, probably over an earlier light crossing through by Hand II.
                            This cut is obviously the result of omitting Lady Macduff's son, but the
                            omission of these lines makes nonsense of Lady Macduff's reply, which is
                            untouched. D'Avenant substitutes 'Heaven protect you.'; Douai MS retains
                            the present lines but cuts 23-25 (' . . . before.') and 27-30 (' . . .

                            dialogue of the Murderers is cut, the call would ordinarily have been
                            cancelled. Someone has drawn what looks like a phallic symbol above Hand

                                'the King of England's Palace'. This scene is cut
                            by about 77 lines in Padua PB; D'Avenant reduces Shakespeare's 240 lines
                            to 167 (divided into two scenes, IV.iii and IV.v); Douai MS omits about
                            10 lines; Bell, according to Gentleman's note, omits about 80 lines,
                            "which retained, would render it painfully tedious"; Lee keeps as a
                            single scene but reduces the lines to roughly 148. In view of all this,

                            adopts D'Avenant's version of 133-135, preceding it with 'Come, cheer

                            suggests that he originally included these lines, and probably those of
                            the preceding cut, and supports the view that the cutting at this point
                            is the work of Hand IV (see above, 113).139 s.d.-159 Enter a Doctor. / Mal. Well .

                            retains the Doctor but cuts 149 ('How . . . ')-159; D'Avenant cuts the
                            Doctor but retains eight lines on the King's healing power (completely
                            rewritten); Bell, Lee, Collier MS cut as in PB. Gentleman's comment
                            (Bell) is pungent and to the point: "The author has here lugged in, by
                            neck and heels, a doctor, for the strange purpose of paying a gross
                            compliment to that royal line, which ridiculously arrogated a power of
                            curing the evil, by a touch. But that scene is properly left out in the
                            representation." This note, as usual, is considerably softened in the

                                'Doctor,'. Hand II seems to have planned the scene as in F
                            (see above, V.ii.25). When, however, scene ii was cut, by Hand ?III, it
                            became necessary to change the Doctor's entrance to avoid an exit at the
                            end of V.i and immediate re-entry at the beginning at V.iii. The initial
                            move to get rid of scene ii has been attributed to Hand III because the
                            Doctor's entrance at 33-34 is partly in Hand III ('Enter [Hand
                                IV] Doc&lt;tor&gt; [Hand III]') and would seem to
                            suggest that Hand III, therefore, had something to do with the cutting
                            of scene ii. Such an explanation supposes that Hand III allowed Hand
                            II's call for Macbeth and the Doctor at V.ii.15 to serve, neglecting to
                            cancel the call for the Doctor at that point. Why the call for the
                            Doctor, tentatively assigned to Hand ?IV, at the beginning of scene iii
                            was deleted (if it was not accidentally smudged) is not clear. D'Avenant
                            omits the Doctor; Bell, Lee enter him at 37, essentially as in PB (the
                            first edition of Bell, 1773, accidentally retained him in the opening
                            s.d.).13 Seyton [Hand II] Smyth [Hand

                            IV). The line carried on across the right margin from the deletion may
                            be intended to mark the point of the Doctor's actual entrance. This is
                            the first of three cuts relating to Macbeth's armor (see below, 48 and
                            v.51-52), and it would seem that the intention was to dress Macbeth in
                            some costume more nearly contemporary; if so, then 33-34, above, were
                            overlooked. Note that the reference to Macbeth's shield at V.viii.32-34
                            is part of a cut by Hand III. That this was the intention, however, is
                            suggested by the deletion of all references to armor in D'Avenant,
                            followed by Lee (except for the reference to 'Hamess' in V.v.51-52);
                            Bell retains the references to armor, indicating, perhaps, a retum to
                            more historical costuming (see, however, p. 8, note 17).39 Cure her of that] Hand III crosses through

                            The added lines in PB have been crossed through, but again presumably by
                            the nineteenth-century exhibitor. The action in PB is not entirely
                            clear. The F s.d. at 34 'Exeunt fighting. Alarums. / Enter fighting,
                                and Macbeth slain.' has been left untouched, but the added
                            lines in PB seem to rule out any exit and make it clear that Macbeth is
                            slain on stage immediately after fighting with Macduff, who then exits,
                            as in D'Avenant. It is surprising that PB retains the business of
                            Macbeth's head, in view of D'Avenant's more decorous substitution of his
                            sword, followed by both Bell and Lee. Since Macbeth's body apparently
                            remains on stage (a difficulty also with the F text), one must suppose
                            that Macduff exits with the head at 34. Bell, Lee give Macbeth an

                            death most natural."); the speech begins with two lines suggested by
                            D'Avenant's line ''Tis done! the scene

                            The lines have been deleted in probably three stages. First, 38-53 (' .

                            36-37 seem to have been circled and the last half of 53 crossed through
                            by Hand IV; third, 35 was included in the cut with 36-37 by Hand IV
