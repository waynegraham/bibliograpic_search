              give setting as 'A Palace.'. Garrick, G-C PB give no setting, but G-C PB
              notes 'Chorus Dircd:'.3-8 but oh . . . time:] Hand I cuts 3-8, by three
              bracketings and crossing through, and substitutes '&amp; then' above F 'Moon:' (8),
              with a caret after 'Moon'. 'This old Moon wanes?' (4) is not included in the
              bracketing, only crossed through. The 't' in F 'steep' (7) appears to have been
              altered to 's'. The function of the cross placed after 5 is not clear; sometimes a
              cross is used to mark a marginal insertion. Nursery PB cuts 13-19; FQ, 1-20;
              Garrick, 5- 13, 17; G-C PB, G-C, 8.9 Hip And then] Hand I inserts 'Hip' at beginning of 9 to
              replace canceled F speech-prefix at 7. As PB now stands, Hippolyta would seem to pick
              up and repeat Hand I's addition to Theseus' speech at 3 above. Probably, however,
              '&amp; then' in 3 was only intended as a cue to indicate where Hippolyta's speech
              should begin. FQ omits the character of Hippolyta throughout.11 Philostrates] Hand I adds 's' to F
                'Philostrate', thus altering the pronunciation.15 turn] Hand I deletes F 'pomp' and substitutes 'turn'
              following F period.18 strain] Hand I deletes F 'key' and substitutes 'strain'
              following F comma.20 Be ever Happy] Hand I deletes F 'be' after 'Happy' and
              inserts 'Be ever' above F 'Ege. Happy'.24 (Stand forth Demetrius.)] Hand I places this F
              s.d. in parentheses. FQ first recognized that these words were part of Egeus'
              speech; followed by Rowe. Hand I's intention here is not clear.26 (Stand forth Lysander.)] Hand I places this F
              s.d. in parentheses. See 24.26 my gracious Duke] Crossed through.28-29 Thou, thou . . . child:] Bracketed, with crosses at
              either end. Nursery PB cuts 33-35; FQ, 29-32, 34; Garrick, G-C PB, 28-35;
              G-C, 29 ('thou hast . . .')-38 ('. . . harshnesse.').30 in evenings] Hand I deletes F 'by Moon-light' and
              inserts above 'in evenings'; Hand I originally wrote 'in evenings' following end of
              line and then deleted it.31 Songs of more faining] Hand I deletes F 'verses',
              inserting 'Songs' above, and inserts 'more' above, with a caret, after F 'of'; Hand I
              originally wrote 'Songs of' following end of line and then deleted it.32 fansie] Hand I deletes 'ta' in F 'fantasie'.33 knacks] Hand I deletes F 'gaudes' and substitutes
              'knacks' (borrowed from 34) above F 'conceits', with a caret under deleted 'gaudes'.
                FQ substitutes 'Lockets' for 'gaudes'.34-38 Knacks, trifles . . . harshnesse.] Bracketed. See
              28-29.38 my gracious Lord] Hand I deletes F 'And' and inserts
              'Lord' following deleted F 'Duke'. FQ reads 'If therefore, (Royal Sir)'; G-C
              reads 'And, my noble Lord,'.39 If strait] Hand I deletes F 'Be it so and inserts 'If
              strait' (followed by a crossed circle) at end of line, marking the point of insertion
              at beginning of line by a repeated crossed circle. FQ, following its change
              in 38, reads 'My Daughter does' for F 'Be . . . will'.48-51 yea, and . . . it:] Crossed through; F 'yea' altered
              to 'yes' before deletion (FQ reads 'yes'). Nursery PB cuts 48-51;
              FQ, 52-55; Garrick, 48 ('yea, . . .')-55; G-C PB, G-C, 47-51.65 immediatly or] Hand I deletes F 'the death, or to' and
              inserts 'immediatly or' above, with a caret, after F 'die'. FQ omits any
              reference to the death penalty.71 Immurd For ever in a shady Cloister.] Hand I places
              'Immurd' at beginning of 71, crosses through F 'aye to be', inserting 'ever' above,
              inserts 'a' above, with a caret, after F 'in', and deletes F 'mew'd,', placing a
              period after F 'Cloister'. FQ reads 'To be immur'd for ever in a
              Cloister.'.72-78 To live . . . blessednesse.] Circled. Nursery PB
              cuts 67-78; FQ, 72-90 (essentially), inserting 6 lines, mostly original;
              Garrick, 67-70; G-C PB, 71-73, 75; G-C, 68, 71-73, 75.Image of prompt-book page 14679 So will I live] Hand I deletes F 'grow, so' after 'I'.
              The words are deleted because of reference to 78, showing that Hand I was preparing
              his text with some care. Nursery PB substitutes 'I will doe either' for 79.83 until] Hand I deletes F 'and by' end, with a caret,
              inserts 'until' above.85 bonds] Hand I adds 's' to F 'bond'. Nursery PB cuts
              84-86; Garrick, G-C, 85; for FQ, see 72-78.88 as he would] Crossed through. G-C replaces these words
              and 89-90 with 'or protest / A single life on chaste Diana's altar.'; for FQ,
              see 72-78.90 ever] Hand I deletes F 'aye' and inserts 'ever'
              above.92 vncertain] Hand I deletes F 'crazed', places a cross
              above it, and writes 'vncertain' in left margin (presumably another cue cross was
              shaved off in rebinding). FQ reads 'doubtful'; Garrick cuts 92-96; G-C, 92,
              95-96.95 tis] Hand I deletes F 'Scornful! Lysander:'
              and inserts 'tis' above F colon.98 &lt;co&gt;nfer vpon] Hand I deletes F 'estate unto',
              places a cue cross below it, and writes '&lt;co&gt;nfer vpon' in left margin
              (presumably another cue cross was shaved off in rebinding). FQ reads 'I give,
              and settle on'. See 92.106 face,] Hand I deletes F 'head' and inserts 'face,'
              following. FQ substantially rewrites 99-110, omitting 106; Garrick cuts
              99-105; G-C, 102, telescoping 106-107.108 too] Hand I deletes F 'soul' and inserts 'too' above.
                FQ reads 'Love'.112-114 And with . . . it.] Circled. FQ cuts
              112-127, substituting four lines based on 117-121; Garrick, 112-114 ('. . . it.'),
              telescoping the rest of 114 and 115, 117-127, substituting two original lines after
              116; G-C PB, 120; G-C, 120, 122 ('what . . .')-127.114-127 But Demetrius . . . you.] Hand I
              rearranges these lines, with some changes and omissions, in two slightly different
              ways. First, with a circled note at the end of 115, cued by a cross ('here bring / in
                ye last 3 lines / &amp; yn go on wth / for you fair' [note circled and crisscrossed through]), he
              reads: 'But Demetrius come, / And you [for deleted F
                'come']Egeus, you shall along [for deleted F 'go'] with me, / I
              must employ you in some businesse of our own / and conferre with you / Of something,
              nearly that concerns your selves. / For you fair Hermia, look you arme your
              self / To fit your fancie ['s' of F 'fancies' deleted] to your Fathers will;
              / Or else the Law of Athens yields you up / To death, or to a vow of single
              life. [F period not deleted] / Which by no means we may extenuate) / Come my
                Hippolita,'. Hand I's first version thus cuts 116 (bracketed and crossed
              through), 122 ('what . . . Love?' bracketed and crossed through), 123 (crossed through
              only), ('Against our nuptialls,' bracketed and crossed through), 127 (bracketed and
              crossed through). The transposition of 120 and 121 is indicated by a small '2' and '1'
              to the left of these lines, and the jump to 121 is cued by 'to death' (Hand I)
              following 119. Hand I may originally have intended to retain
               123 in place of 114 ('But . . ')-115, since it is
              only crossed through, not bracketed; indeed, the crossing through may be entirely
              associated with Hand I's second version. This second version, considerably shaved in
              rebinding differs from the first only in some slight variations from the F text in
              124-126. Crossing out both his note following 115 (see above) and lines 124-127 (127
              being also bracketed, probably earlier for version one), Hand I writes in left margin
              opposite 116-120: '&lt;I mus&gt;t imploy / &lt;you in&gt; som busines / &lt;of our&gt;
              own &amp; then / &lt;conferre&gt; wth you / &lt;?on t&gt;hat
              concerns / &lt;your s&gt;elves.' It is difficult to be sure of the word (or words)
              following 'wth you', though clearly the full F reading ('Of
              something, nearly') is too long to have been fitted into the available marginal
              space.128 &lt;Wh&gt;y dearest Hermia] Hand I deletes F'How now
              my Love? Why' and substitutes the lemma in left margin. FQ, G-C PB, G-C cut
              128-131.130 Perhaps] Hand I deletes F 'Belike' and writes
              'Perhaps' in left margin, cued with a cross.131 afford] Hand I deletes F 'Beteem' and writes 'afford'
              in left margin.132 hear] Hand I originally wrote 'or hear' after F
              'read,', then deleted both F 'read' and 'or'. Nursery PB cuts 132-156; FQ
              reads 132 as '0 my true Hermia! I have never found'.133 Could ever . . . History,] Bracketed and crossed
              through. FQ reads 133-134 as 'By observation, nor by History, / That Lovers
              run a smooth, and even course:'.134 course of love yet] Hand I deletes F 'true' before
              'love' and inserts 'yet' following 'love'. See 133.135-149 But either . . .
                confusion.] Bracketed and partly circled. Hand ?II, however, corrects F 'to'
              (148) to 'do'. For Nursery PB, see 132; FQ cuts 137-140, telescopes 144-145
              ('Swift as the Lightning in the blackest night;'), and considerably rewrites the lines
              retained; Garrick cuts 136, 138, 140, 144-149; G-C, 136, 138, 140 (so G-C PB, but
              marked 'stet' ). Gentleman (Bell) comments favorably on 135-149 "The intersection of
              these single lines has a pretty effect in reading, and must have a better on the
              stage."151 Sure 'tis ye inevita / ble law of
                fate] Hand I, crossing through 151 ('It stands as an Edict in destiny:'),
              substitutes the lemma to the right, flanked by small crosses before 'Sure' and after
              'inevita'. A third cross has been placed at the beginning of 151, which may refer to a
              word (or words) crossed through to the left of 151, possibly 'inevitable' (Hand I).
              For Nursery PB, see 132; FQ reads 'a Decree' for F 'an Edict'; G-C PB, G-C
              cut, though earlier in G-C PB a now illegible word was interlined,
               with a caret, after 'edict'. Gentleman (Bell)
              offers an amusing comment: "We love not mention of destiny unless to refute so
              prejudicial and uncomfortable a notion; the idea here inculcated, especially
              respecting Love, is too much encouraged both among young and old."152 nature] Hand I crosses through F 'Triall' and inserts
              'nature' above. FQ substitutes 'each other' for F 'our triall'; G-C PB, G-C
              retain 152 but read 'Oh' for F 'Then'.153-155 Because it . . . followers.] Circled. For Nursery
              PB, see 132; FQ cuts 154-155; G-C, 153-155.156 Lys: thy Love has / counsell'd well; then] Hand I, by
              crossing through, substitutes the lemma (all but 'then' written in left column) for F
                'Lys. [not deleted] A good perswasion; therefore' ('therefore'
              altered to 'then' by crossing through 'refore' and inserting 'n' above). FQ
              reads 156 as ' 'Tis well advis'd, my Hermia, / Pray hear me.'158 has] Hand I alters F 'hath' to 'has'. FQ
              reads 'has', but substantially rewrites the whole speech; Garrick cuts 157 160; G-C
              PB, G-C, 158.164 from] Hand I crosses through 'orth' in F 'forth' and
              inserts 'rom' above. So FQ.167 To doe . . . May)] Bracketed and crossed through.
              Nursery PB cuts 166-167; FQ rewrites 167-168 ('. . . thee.').168 dear Lysander, here] Hand I crosses through F 'good
                Lysander,' and, following, substitutes the lemma.169-170 by Cupid's . . . head,] Bracketed and crossed
              through. FQ cuts 171-174 and telescopes 177-178; Garrick, 173-174 and
              replaces 177-178 with a new couplet; G-C PB, 172-174, 176; G-C, 170-174, 176-l77.
              Gentleman (Bell) comments on 169-176: "There could not be a prettier or more fervent
              set of oaths coined in the amorous stile than those uttered by Hermia with so
              much affectionate delicacy; but we wish our Author had not here, nor on any other
              occasion, changed pleasing emphatic blank verse for unpleasing unnatural rhimes."172 ties our souls] Hand I crosses through F 'knitteth'
              and inserts 'ties our' above.173-174 And by . . . seen,] Crossed through and partly
              circled. See 169-170.177-178 I will not / fail to meet / thee] Hand I crosses
              through 177-178 ('In that . . . thee.') and substitutes the lemma to the right.
                FQ reduces 177-178 to 'I will, where thou appoint'st, meet my
                Lysander.'; Garrick rewrites as 'Hermia to-morrow in the depth of
              night / Will meet Lysander, and attempt her flight.' See 169-170.179 We are surprizd] Hand I crosses through F 'Keep
              promise Love' and substitutes the lemma below. FQ substitutes 'Enough, my
              Love: '; Garrick cuts 179.180 Now fairest Helena, whither now?] Hand I
              crosses through F 'God speed', placing 'Now' above, adds 'est' after and above F
              'fair', and crosses through F 'away', placing 'now' above. FQ reduces to
              'Welcome, fair Helena.'.181-182 oh no! / Demetrius thinks you] Hand I
              first crosses through 'say' in F 'unsay' and writes 'speak' immediately following
              (thus reading 'unspeak'); he then crosses through F 'that fair again unsay,' and
              'speak' and writes 'oh no!' above his deleted 'speak', crossing through F 'loves'
              (182) and inserting, with a caret, 'thinks' above. The change to 'thinks' probably
              resulted from the F reading 'loves you fair' ('your' in Q1-2). FQ rewrites
              181-182 and cuts 183-185; Garrick turns F 'fair: O happy fair!' (182) into 'O Hermia
                fair, O happy, happy fair,' as the first line of a six-line song
              composed otherwise of 183-185, 192-193, cutting 186-191 (so G-C, except for 182, which
              reads 'Demetrius loves you, fair;'); G-C PB calls for a song after 'you fair;' and
              circles 183-185, 187 ('ere I go;'), 190-191.183-191 Your eyes . . .translated.] Circled. See
              181-182.193 empire] Hand I crosses through F 'motion' and
              inserts, with a caret, 'empire' above.199 hates poor me.] Hand I deletes 'th' in F 'hateth',
              adds 's' above, and places 'poor', with a caret, after F 'me.' (caret repeated after
              'hates'). FQ cuts 198-199; Garrick, 196-201; G-C PB, G-C, 194-201.204-207 for since I cannot wth Lysander be,
                / at Athens, tis a perfect hell to me] Hand I
              substitutes the lemma, below 205, for F 204-207 ('Before the . . . Hell?'), which are
              bracketed and crossed through. A cross, to the right of 206-207, indicates where the
              new couplet is to be placed. FQ cuts 203-207; Garrick, G-C PB, G-C turn
              204-207 into a song lyric (G-C PB circles the lines).Image of prompt-book page 147209 Luna] Hand I crosses through, with a small cross
              below, F 'Phœbe' and writes 'Luna', with a small cross below, following
              end of 209. So FQ ('This very night, when Luna does behold').213 gates we have contrivd] Hand I adds 's' to F 'gate'
              (over F comma), crosses through F 'have we devis'd', and, with a caret after 'gates',
              substitutes 'we have contrivd', inserted at end of 213 (marked with another caret).
              Originally, Hand I had crossed through F 'devis'd' and inserted 'contrivd' above
              (crossed through). FQ rewrites 213 as 'We from this cursed Town will steal
              away.'216 of their counsell sweld] Crossed through. FQ
              changes to 'of our secret thoughts' and cuts 220-225, replacing 224-225 with a new
              couplet; Garrick cuts 220-224 ('pray thou . . . Hermia.'); G-C PB, 214-219,
              221; G-C, 221.219-221 part wth enemies / Farewell sweet
                maid, wish thou / well to us, / And Heaven] Hand I crosses through F 'and
              strange companions,' ('and' probably deleted in error), inserts 'part wth enemies' above, crosses through F 'play-fellow, pray thou for us' (220),
              inserting 'maid' above 'play-' (followed by a cross), writes 'wish thou [thou
                written above a deleted but] / well to us' at end of 220 (preceded by a
              cross), and crosses through F 'good luck' (221), inserting 'Heaven' above. See
              216.222-225 Keep word . . . you.] Circled and crossed
              through. Hand ?II has deleted 's' in F 'dotes'(225), following Q1-2. See 216.225 s.d. Exit Hermia / and / Lysander.] Hand I
              originally wrote '(Exit)' after 221, crossed through F 'Exit Hermia.' after
              223, then changed his mind, crossed through his first Exit)' and added 'Exit Hermia /
              and' above F 'Exit Lysander.' (225), crossing through F 'Exit'.
                FQ, Garrick exit Hermia and Lysander together.229 does] Hand ?II crosses through F 'th' in 'cloth' and
              inserts 'es' above.230-245 And as . . . melt.] Bracketed, with a small cross
              after 236. Hand ?II deletes the F commas after 'eyes' and 'figure' in 237 (so Collier
              MS). Rowe first dropped the comma after 'figure', though FQ rephrases to make
              the syntax clear. The inkstroke on 'l' in F 'looks' (234) seems to be meaningless.
                FQ rewrites 226-227, 229 and cuts 230-233 (frequently rephrasing the lines
              retained); Garrick cuts 229-233, 240-245, 248 ('and for . . .')-251, substituting
              226-228 after F 'Pursue her;' (248), linked by an original passage ('I'll at distance
              steal behind, / His sight alone will ease my tortur'd mind.'), and ending with 234-239
              arranged as a song"; G-C PB, G-C cut 229-241, 244-245, and conclude with a four-line
              lyric based in part on 250-251 (G-C PB merely calls for a song, deleting 250-251).248 this] Hand ?II adds 't' before F 'his' (following
                Q1-2).249-251 tis A vast recompence / But poor in Love I to enrich my
                pain, / wish but his sight] Hand I crosses through F 'it is a dear expence:'
              and, following, inserts 'tis A vast recompence' ('A vast' written above a deleted 'a
              great' and 'pence' written above 'recom', with a caret after 'm'); crosses through F
              'herein mean' (250), inserting 'poor in Love' above; crosses through F 'To have' (251)
              and writes 'wish' in left margin, inserting 'but' above F 'have' (originally Hand I
              deleted only F 'To' and wrote 'wo'ud' in left margin [deleted], thus reading
               'wo'ud have his sight'). FQ reduces
              249-251 to 'And if he thanks me, I am overpaid.'

              deleted the F comma after 'yet' and inserted a comma after 'rest'. Theobald first made
              a substantially similar emendation. FQ converts F 'To the rest' into a s.d.;

              first wrote 'with' above 'incensd', smudged it through, and repeated 'with' below. G-C
              turns 20 into a question ('But why is Oberon so fell and wrath?') asked by the First
              Fairy.21 for] Hand I crosses through F 'as' and inserts 'for'
              above. So FQ.29 sheen] Hand ?I seems to have doctored 'ee' in F
              'sheen', placing what looks like the dot of an 'i' between the two letters and
              touching up both 'e's. FQ reads 29 as 'By Fountain, or by Star-light, are
              they seen:' and cuts 27, 45-46, 54-57; Garrick cuts 22-23 ('stoln . . . changeling,'),
              reads 'and he' in 24 for F 'And jealous Oberon', and cuts 26-57; G-C PB cuts

              square'; for Garrick, see 29; G-C reads 'For' for F 'But'.32 making] Hand I crosses through F 'quite' after F
              'making'. Acting texts that retain 32 read 'Or' for F 'Either' (see 29).35-42 That fright . . . he?]
              Circled, with a cross to right. Originally only 36-37 ('and . . . chern,') were

              I intends us to read 'ins' as meaning "in his", the reason for the emendation lying in
              the erroneous 'like' introduced by F3 (followed by F4 and Rowe) for Q1-2, F1-2 'of' (first
              restored by Pope); Theobald first restored Q1 'filly'.48-57 In very . . . there.] Circled, with a cross to
              right. See 29.59 s.d. Scen continues.] Hand I, to the right and below
              59, inserts 'Scen continues.' (i.e., 'the New Grove' at beginning of Act II). The
              reason for the notation does not seem apparent, since there is no exit or cleared
              stage at this point.61 Fairys skip ye hence.] Hand I inserts 's' above F
              'Fairy' and 'ye', with a caret, above F 'skip hence'. FQ substitutes 'Faries
                [sic] away,'. Theobald wac the first editor to emend to 'fairies' (not
              followed by G-C PB, G-C).64 it is confest / insulting / Oberon but / yet I know]
              Hand I crosses through 64 ('Then I . . . know'), placing a cross after F speech-prefix
                "Qu.', and inserts the lemma, preceded by another cross in right margin
              opposite 63-66. FQ reads 64 as 'And am not I your Lady too? Remember'
              (changing F 'Wanton' (63) to the more decorous 'Woman') and very considerably rewrites
              65-80; Garrick cuts 63-118; G-C PB, G-C, 64-68 ('but I . . . Phillida.').67 makeing] Hand I crosses through F 'versing' and
              inserts, with a caret, 'makeing' above. FQ substitutes 'Singing'. See 64.69 part] Hand I crosses through F 'steep' and inserts,
              with a caret, 'part' above. FQ substitutes 'Verge'; G-C PB reads
              'step' (as later emended by Capell).79 Ægle] Hand II substitutes 'Æ' and deletes
              's' in F 'Eagles'. FQ, Garrick omit the classical reference; other acting
              texts read 'Egle' or 'Ægle' (first emended to 'Ægle' by Rowe).82-85 since the . . . sea,] Hand I, placing a small cross
              to right and left, brackets and crosses through in two stages: 83 ('on hill . .
              .')-85; 82 ('since the . . .')-85; in F 'or by rushie brook,' only 'rushie' crossed
              through. Part of longer cut in Garrick (63-118); G-C cuts 85.86 met we] Hand I inserts 'met me' to left of 86 to
              replace F 'Met we' (83) deleted in second stage of 82-85.86 the wind] Hand I crosses through F 'whistling' before
              F 'wind'. Part of longer cut in Garrick (63-118).88-111 the winds . . . set.]

              part of longer cut in Garrick (63-118); G-C PB, G-C cut as in PB, including, however,
              F 'Therefore' in 88.Image of prompt-book page 149112 The Autumn] Hand I crosses through F 'childing' after
              F 'The', presumably not understanding the word. G-C PB, G-C read 'chiding' (following
              Pope). See 88-111.121 Page] Hand I crosses through F 'Henchman' and inserts
              'Page' following. FQ reads 121 as 'Give me him, we are Friends.'; Garrick
              cuts 121.128 we have laught] Hand II inserts, with a caret, 'have'
              above F 'we laught' (as in Q1-2, F1-2; first
              restored by Rowe). Nursery PB cuts 98-187; FQ, 124-135; Garrick, 126-134; G-C
              PB,G-C, 131.145 for / we shall / quarrell] Hand 1 crosses through F
              'We shall chide down right,' (placing a small circle on F 'We') and inserts the lemma,
              preceded by a crossed circle, in left margin opposite 143-144 (possibly a deleted
              'and' was originally written preceding Hand I's 'we' and replaced by 'for' above).
              Nursery PB cuts 98-187; FQ reads 145 as 'We chide down-right, if I
                should longer stay.'; Garrick cuts 145 (reading 'Elves away.' in 144) and
              inserts a song; G-C PB calls for 'Song' after 145; G-C cuts 144 ('Fairies away:')-l45
              and inserts a new song.149 Since once I] Hand II inserts, with a caret after F
              'Since', 'once' above F 'I' (as in Q1-2, F1;
              first restored by Pope). Nursery PB cuts 98-187; FQ reads 'Since when I';
              Garrick cuts 149-168; G-C PB, G-C, 148 ('thou. . .')-168.151 such sweet and such harmonious] Hand I crosses
              through F 'dulcet' and inserts 'sweet' and 'such' above F 'harmonious'. Some hand,
              probably not Hand I, has placed an index-hand 
              pointing to 151 in left margin, the only example of this sign in PB. Why this line
              should be singled out for special emphasis is unclear, unless it is intended to call
              attention to the similarity of the changes found in FQ ('Sing with such
              sweet, with such Harmonious breath,'). See 149.153] The ink mark after F 'Shpears,' appears to be a
              showthrough from F p. 150.155 saw] Hand II crosses through 'y' in F 'say' and
              inserts 'w' above (following Q1; first restored by Rowe).158-165 throned by . .
                  .Cupid fell.] Circled (see note on 166). FQ heavily
              rewrites. See 149.166 but the bolt fell s&lt;?hort&gt;] Hand I crosses
              through F 'It fell' and, cued by a cross before 166, writes the lemma (preceded by a
              cross) to right of 166.174 ere I can say wha&lt;t . . .&gt;] Hand I crosses
              through F 174 ('Ere . . . league.') and writes lemma to right of 173. What appears to
              be an illegible word following 174 is probably only a showthrough from F p.150.175 girdle round about the earth,] Hand II inserts
              'round' above F 'about' (restoring Q1) and places a comma after F
              'earth' (as in Q1-2, F1-2); Pope first
              restored Q1 'round'. FQ reads 175 as 'I'll compass the
              whole Earth in forty minutes.'179 which] Hand II crosses through F 'when' and places
              'which' to right of 179 (following Rowe); Capell first restored Q1
              'then'. FQ reads 179 as 'The next Live Thing she waking looks upon,'.181 the busie Ape] Hand I crosses through F 'on' and
              inserts 'the' above. So FQ, reading also 'The' for F 'On'; Garrick cuts
              180-181; G-C telescopes 180-181 into '(Be it on bear, lion, wolf, bull, ape, or
              monkey),'.183 her] Hand ?I corrects the turned 'r' in F 'her'.190 The one . . . me.] Crossed through. FQ cuts
              190 and reduces 192-194 to one line; Garrick cuts 188-193; G-C PB, 190-193; G-C,
              189-193.192-193 And here . . . Hermia.] Circled. See
              190.196-197 But yet . . . steel.] Crossed through.
                FQ reduces 196-197 to 'And yet I am not Iron, yet you draw me.'; Garrick
              cuts 195-213; G-C reduces 196-198 to 'You draw me on, I cannot help but follow.'; G-C
              PB reduced 196-197 ('. . . steel.') as in G-C, but added 'Demetrius' at end of
              197.197 Leave you] Hand II inserts 'you', with a caret, after
              F 'Leave' (restoring Q1-2, F1-2, as does
              Rowe). See 196-197.202 love you] Hand I crosses through F 'thee' and inserts
              'you' to the left above (thus reading with Q1; otherwise first
              restored  stored by Capell). Hand I's agreement
              with Q1 is almost certainly accidental, the change being made to
              accord with the 'you' forms in 201, 207. FQ substitutes 'Demetrius'
              for F 'thee'; Garrick cuts 195-213; G-C PB reads 202 as 'For that do I love thee
              more;'; G-C cuts 202-205 ('. . . spaniell;').203-205 I am . . . spaniell;] Circle and crossed through.
                FQ rewrites in part; G-C PB cuts as in PB. See 202.208-210 What worser . . . dog?] Circled. Nursery PB, G-C
              PB cut as in PB; FQ, G-C, 208-213; Garrick, 195-213.219 fair fame] Hand I crosses through F 'virginity' and
              substitutes 'fair fame' to right. FQ reads 219 as 'With the rich purchase of
              your Virgin Treasure.' and cuts 222; Garrick cuts 219-220, 222, 225-226; G-C PB,
              225-226; G-C, 219, 225-226; Gentleman (Bell) suggests cutting 211-234.220 virtue's my protection] Hand I deletes 'i' in F 'is'
              following F 'virtue', inserts an apostrophe, and crosses through F 'priviledge: for
              that'. FQ reads 220 as 'Your Virtue is my Guard, Demetrius:'. See
              219.221 Wth me It is not night when I
                behold] Hand I inserts 'Wth me' before F 'It', crosses
              through F 'do see' (placing a caret below), and writes 'behold', with a caret, at end
              of 221. FQ reads 221 as 'It is not night when I behold that Face,'. See
              219.Image of prompt-book page 150227 &lt;Awa&gt;y or else / ile] Hand I crosses through F
              'I'le run from thee, and' and inserts the lemma in left margin, with a crossed circle
              to mark point of insertion.232 &amp; the Hinde] Hand I inserts '&amp;' before F
              'the' and crosses through F 'milde'. Garrick cuts 232-234; G-C PB, 233 ('Bootless . .
              � )-234; G-C, 230-234.235 &lt;he&gt;ar thy folly] Hand I crosses through F
              'stay thy questions' and inserts the lemma in left margin. FQ reads 235 as
              'Plague me no more, return e'er 'tis too late.' and exits Demetrius at 237 (as does
              G-C PB, G-C).236 darest pursue] Hand I crosses through F 'follow me'
              and inserts 'darest pursue' above. FQ reads 236 as 'Follow me not, for fear
              my Rage should tempt me'.244 by yt dear] Hand I crosses
              through F 'upon the' and inserts, with a caret, 'by yt dear'
              above. The blot above F 'make' in 243 seems meaningless. FQ rewrites 242-243
              and reads 244 as 'I'll kiss the hand that gives the fatal blow.'; Garrick cuts 238-244
              (suggested cut in Gentleman (Bell)); G-C PB, G-C, 240-244.249-256 ye place / &lt;I kn&gt;ow where /
                &lt;?my&gt; Titania / &lt;slee&gt;ps] Hand I circles 249-256 ('I know . . .
              in.') and substitutes the lemma in left margin, with a small crossed circle after 248.
              Nursery PB cuts 249-258; FQ, 258, 265-266 (with rewriting
               of the lines retained); Garrick, 250-252,
              254-258, 267-268; G-C PB originally cut 251-252, but marks them 'stet'; G-C, 250-252,
              255-256, 265-266.249 whereon] Hand II (following Pope) inserts, with a
              caret, 'on' above F 'where'. Acting texts read with Pope, except FQ, which
              reads 249 as 'I know there is a bank where wild Time blows,'.250 Where Oxslips] Hand II (following Pope) crosses
              through F 'the' before 'Oxslips' (F3 first introduced 'the',
              followed by F4 and Rowe). So all acting texts that retain the

              Garrick. In FQ Titania enters with 'her Train' and in a new
              four-line speech orders 'All shall turn to Fairy-Land.'. Thereupon 'The
                Scene changes to a Prospect of Grotto's, Arbors, and delightful Walks: . . .';
              this is followed by 16 new lines, owing something to Shakespeare's song ('You spotted
              Snakes . . .'), A PRELUDE, 'Then the First SONG.', 'Then a Fairy
                Dance.', Shakespeare's lines 1-8 (slightly rewritten), '2. SONG.' (by
              Night, Mystery, Secresie, and Sleep), 'A Dance of the Followers of Night.'
              (here picking up Oberon's speech at 27). G-C PB begins Act III here and indicates
              change of scene by 'O 3 / Banks'; G-C also begins Act III here and gives the scene as
                'The Wood.'.2-8 &lt;y&gt;e Song [crossed through]

              ('Then for . . . rest.'), places '&lt;y&gt;e Song' in left margin
              below 8 (later crossed through), and then repeats 8 to left of F s.d. 'Fairies
                Sing.', adding 'fairy dance' to the right of s.d. The arrangement here is not
              entirely clear. '&lt;y&gt;e Song' was presumably deleted when Hand
              I decided to retain 8 and recopied it below; the 'fairy dance' is called for by F
              'Roundell' in 1 and is not an independent dance but accompanied the following F song.
              Nursery PB cuts 1-34; for FQ, see preceding note; Garrick cuts 7 ('Sing . .
              .')-8; none of the acting texts, except Bottom the Weaver (s.d. 'Fayries
                first Dance, and then sings 1.'), FQ and PB, specifically calls for a
              dance.14 her asleep wth] Hand I crosses
              through F 'in your sweet' and substitutes 'her asleep wth' above

              partly crisscrossed. Garrick cuts 25-26. See 2-8.34s.d. Exit / Scene / is / The little / wood] Hand I,
              alone among acting texts (except Reynolds), introduces a new setting here. He also
              (along with Bottom the Weaver) furnishes the necessary 'Exit' for Oberon
              (found later, following Rowe, in all acting texts).35 wood] Hand ?II crosses through 's' in F 'woods' (as in
                Q1; first restored by FQ, Rowe). Among acting texts
              only Nursery PB reads 'woods'.36 truth] Hand ?II alters 'o' in F 'troth' to 'u'. So

              way'.41-65 Lys. One turfe . . . prest.] Circled.
                FQ reduces 39-65 to four-and-a-half lines (partly rewritten); Garrick cuts
              43-63; G-C PB, 43-64 ('. . . bed,'), inserting, in Garrick's hand, the following
              lines: 'Her. My gentle Friend, for Love &amp; Courtesy, / Permit me this one

              watch thee thro' ye Night, / Nor harm shall reach thee—/

              my Lysander, on that . . .', and his 'My Honor . . . shine', correcting 'Nor' to 'No'
              in line 10; Gentleman (Bell) suggests cutting 43-62, adding "The passages here marked
              should be omitted, for though founded in delicacy, they may raise warm ideas."66 Through] Something appears to be written above 'T' in F
              'Through'; probably only part of the circling of 41-65.Image of prompt-book page 15177 near the man / loves Enemy] Hand I crosses through F 77
              ('Near . . . curtesie.') and inserts the lemma to right. FQ, Garrick cut
              76-77 (FQ rewriting parts of the speech); G-C PB cuts 'this lack-love, this'
              in F 77 and then inserts between 77 and 78 the following (in Garrick's hand): 'But
              first I'll throw this Youth into a Trance / That fairy Sprites may round him Dance, /
              Melting Sounds your Power impart / That I may pierce his harden'd heart. /

              shall fill:' (78-83 follow); G-C retains Garrick's insertion (with slight verbal
              changes), but cuts 76-77, 80-81; Gentleman (Bell) suggests cutting 76-77 and reading
              78 as 'Upon thy maiden eyes I throw,'.84 Stay . . . dear] Hand I crosses through F 'Say' (an
              error first appearing in F2), writes 'Spe' (i.e., the first
              letters of 'Speak') above, deletes it, and inserts 'Stay' to right; he then crosses
              through F 'sweet' and substitutes 'dear' above ('Stay', probably coincidentally,
              restores the Ql-2, F1 reading). FQ
              cuts 84-87.86 thou canst / not leave / me weried / wth
                my woe] Hand I crosses through F 86 ('0 wilt . . . so.') and substitutes the
              lemma in left margin (cued with a crossed circle above 'thou' to the opening F '0',
              with a vertical line through it, of 86). For FQ, see 84; Garrick substitutes
              'darling' for F 'darkling'; G-C PB, G-C read 86 as '0 wilt thou leave me? do not so,
              my Love.'.88 &amp; sunk wth greife] Hand I
              crosses through F 'in this fond chase,' and substitutes the lemma immediately above.
                FQ substitutes 'with following him so fast.'; Garrick cuts 88-89.89 I pray, the lesse is my releife] Hand I, in F 'my
              prayer', crosses through 'my' and 'er' in 'prayer' and inserts 'I' above, crosses
              through both final 'r' in F 'lesser' and F 'grace', and inserts 'releife' to right.
                FQ cuts 89; for Garrick, see 88; G-C PB, G-C substitute 'favour' for F
              'grace'.91 charming] Hand I crosses through F 'blessed' and, with
              a caret below both, writes 'charming' to left of 91. FQ rephrases 91 as 'How
              her attractive Eyes still draw him on!'; G-C PB reads 91 as 'she hath attractive &amp;
              bewitching Eyes'; G-C cuts 90-99.94-99 No, no . . . eyne?] Circled, but originally
              bracketed, the brackets including 100-101, which Hand I then recognized as necessary
              for sense. Nursery PB cuts 98-99; FQ, Garrick, 94-99; G-C PB, 92-98; G-C,
              90-99; Gentleman (Bell) suggests cutting 92-97.101 nor] Hand I adds 'r' to F 'no'. FQ rewrites
              100-102 as two lines; G-C cuts last half of 101 ('I . . . wound,').102 Lysander! if you live, Lysander, wake] Hand
              I converts the comma after F 'Lysander' into an exclamation mark, crosses
              through F 'good sir', inserts, with a caret, 'Lysander' above, and deletes the initial
              'a' in F 'awake'. FQ reads 102 as 'I hope he is not dead! Lysander,
              speak.'.103 I would for thy deer sake.] Hand I crosses through F
              'will' and inserts 'would' above; then crosses through F 'sweet' and inserts 'deer'
              above. FQ completely rewrites 103-107; Garrick
               inserts a song after 102 and cuts 103; G-C PB,
              G-C read 'for thee, sweet Helena.' for F 'I . . . sake.' and cut 104-105.106-107 Where is Demetrius? yt
                disdainfull Ld / tis iust yt he shoud perish
                by] Hand I inserts 'is' above after F 'Where'; crosses through F 'oh how fit
              a word' (106) and inserts yt disdainfull Ld'
              following; crosses through F 'Is that vile name, to' (107), writing 'tis iust yt he shoud' partly in left margin and partly interlined above; and
              crosses through F 'on', inserting 'by' above. 'is' first dropped out in F2; restored editorially by Rowe. For FQ, see 103.108 Now your're / unkind] Hand I crosses through F 'Do
              not say so' and inserts the lemma in left margin. FQ rewrites 108-110,
              reading 'O say not so, Lysander!' for 108.109 Hermia? what though?] Hand I crosses through
              F 'Lord,' before F 'what'. FQ omits F 'Lord, what though?'; Garrick reads
                'Hermia, yet you know,'; G-C PB, G-C read 'Hermia? what of
              that?'.110 while Hermia still is yours, be you
                content,] Hand I deletes F 'Yet' and inserts 'while' in left margin, crosses
              through F 'loves you' and inserts 'is yours' above, deletes F 'then' and inserts
              'you', with a caret, above F 'content,'. FQ reads 'pray be content, / Be
              satisfy'd, your Hermia loves you still.'; Garrick reads 'That' for F 'Yet';
              G-C PB, G-C read 'be satisfy'd' for F 'then be content,'.113-114 Not Hermia . . . Dove?] Circled. G-C
              cuts 113-114.115-116 stat] Hand I, to right, places 'stat' between
              113-114 and 117-120 (both sets of lines circled), possibly indicating the retention of
              the two sets (or the retention of at least the first set), or perhaps simply
              emphasizing the retention of 115-116. FQ cuts 115-116 and rewrites 117-122;
              Garrick cuts 115-122.117-120 Things growing . . . will,] Circled. Nursery PB
              cuts 117-122 (same cut suggested by Gentleman (Bell)); for FQ, Garrick, see
              115-116; G-C PB, G-C cut 117-119.121 It leads] Hand I crosses through F 'And' before F
              'leads' and substitutes 'It' in left margin. See 117-120.123 for mans derision] Hand I crosses through F 'to this
              keen mockery' and inserts, with a caret, the lemma above. FQ rewrites
              123-124, cuts 125-130, rewrites 131-134; Garrick cuts 125-130, 133-134; G-C PB reduces
              123 to 'But wherefore this?', alters 130 to 'To woo me in such disdainfull terms,',
              cuts 'perforce I must confesse,' (131) and 133-134; G-C follows G-C PB in 123, but
              cuts 129-131 as well as 133-134; Gentleman (Bell) suggests cutting 125-130.127-128 Deserve one look from my Demetrius but in
                contempt /  you will upbraid / me thus]
              Hand I crosses through F 'a sweet' and inserts 'one' above, inserts 'my' above between
              F 'from' and 'Demetrius', deletes F 'eye', and crosses through 128,
              substituting, cued with crossed circles, 'but in contempt / you will upbraid / me
              thus' to right of 127-128. See 123.129-130 In troth you do me wrong (indeed you do) / In your
                desdain; / let me pursue / my woe] Hand I deletes F 'Good', inserting, with a
              caret, 'In' above, crosses through F 'good sooth', inserting 'indeed' above, crosses
              through F 'such . . . wooe.' (130) and substitutes, with cue crosses, 'your desdain; /
              let me pursue / my woe' to right of 130-131. See 123.131-134 But fare . . . abus'd.] Circled. See 123.135 She saw not Hermia, sleep thou for ever
                there,] Hand I deletes F 'sees', substituting 'saw' in left margin, places a
              comma after F 'Hermia', and inserts 'for ever' above, with a caret, after F
              'thou' (F3-4 drop a second 'Hermia'&gt;, making the line
              unmetrical). What appears to be a crossing-through of 'Hermia, sleep' and
              parts of 136 is an ink show-through from F p. 152. FQ reads 135 as 'She sees
              not Hermia. Sleep, sleep for ever;' and rewrites 136-144; Garrick cuts
              136-144, adding an original line after 135; G-C PB, G-C cut 143-144.137-142 For as . . . me,] Bracketed. See 135.143-144 Ile all my powers addresse with love and might / To
                Ho&lt;nour&gt; / Helle&lt;n&gt; [or Helle&lt;na&gt;] / favor &lt;me&gt; /
                  ye nig&lt;ht&gt;] Hand I deletes F 'And' and
              substitutes 'Ile' to left; deletes F 'your', inserting 'with' above; deletes F
              'might,', inserting 'might' above, followed by a crossed circle linking to the
              substitution for 144; crosses through F 144 ('To . . . Knight.'), including F
                'Exit.', and substitutes, in right margin, preceded by a crossed circle,
              'To Ho&lt;nour&gt; / Helle&lt;n&gt; [or Helle&lt;na&gt;] / favor &lt;me&gt; /
                ye nig&lt;ht&gt;'. Hand I originally handled 144 differently,
              twice repeating, and each time crossing through, 'favor &lt;me&gt; ye nig&lt;ht&gt;', once after F 'might' (143) and again after F 'Knight.'
              (144), in the second case with a small cross before F 'To' (144), which is repeated
              before 'favor' (presumably, at this stage, letting F 'To honour Helen,'
              stand). The deletion of F 'Exit.' must have been accidental. Nursery PB cuts
              143-144; see 135.150 you] Hand ?II alters F yet' by converting 'et' to
              'ou' (the reading of Q1-2; first adopted by Pope). So all acting
              texts, except FQ, which retains 'yet'.151 Lord!] Hand ?II converts F comma to an exclamation
              mark (first appearing in Rowe). So all acting texts, except FQ, which
              rewrites the last half of 151.153 Alas] Hand ?I converts F 'Alack' by deleting 'ak' and
              inserting  's' above. FQ cuts 148, omits
              'Alack' in rewriting 152-154, and replaces 155-l56 with two new lines; Garrick
              rewrites 153 as 'Where are you, speak? alas! he is not near.' and cuts 154-156; G-C
              PB, G-C cut 155-156.154 or i'm lost] Hand I crosses through F 'of all loves'
              and substitutes 'or i'm lost' in right margin. See 153.156 Or] Hand I deletes F 'Either' and substitutes 'Or' to
              left Pope first read 'Or' in edited texts.

              I. Garrick, as already noticed, omits Bottom and Co., including the whole of this

              Calender' and inserts 'n' above F 'A' followed by 'Almanack'. See III.i (opening).78 s.d. Enter Robin.] Some hand places a large
              cross in left margin opposite the F s.d. The ink smear at 78-80 seems to be merely a
              blot.84 flower] Hand ?II (following Pope) deletes the 's' in F
              'flowers'. See III.i (opening).101] What looks like a pen stroke appears after F 'you'
              (possibly an 'r').105 s.d. Enter Pyramus with the / asse's Head] Hand II
              inserts this s.d. following 105. Rowe first re-entered Bottom here (after 103);
              Hanmer, after 105 (as in PB). Acting texts, retaining this part of the scene, bring
              Bottom on at either 103 or 105.106 s.d. Enter Puck] Hand I inserts the s.d. to right of
              106. Since Puck has been given no exit since his entry after 78, it is not clear why
              he should be given a re-entry here. Even if Hand I does not realize that Puck and
              Robin are one and the same (the erroneous F s.d. at 55 ('Enter Puck.')
              remains undeleted in PB, which also retains F 'Enter Robin.' at 780), his
              confusion does not explain matters, since there is no exit given earlier
               for Robin. Capell is the first editor to exit
              Puck earlier (90) and therefore the first to re-enter him at 105 (as in G-C, Gentleman
              (Bell)).114 s.d.] Hand II crosses through F s.d. 'Enter

              'with' above (the reading of Q1-2, first restored by Pope). The
              small cross in right margin opposite 132 seems to have no function. FQ also
              reads 'with' and so all acting texts that retain the song; see III.i (opening).144 And thy . . . me.] Crossed through. See III.i
              (opening).150 be witty] Hand I deletes F 'gleek', places a caret
              below, and substitutes 'be witty' following end of line. FQ substitutes
              'break a Jest' for 'gleek'. See III.i (opening).158 wait] Hand I deletes F 'tend' and inserts 'wait'
              above. See III.i (opening).162 fragrant flowers do] Hand I deletes F 'pressed',
              substituting 'fragrant' at end of 161, and deletes 'th' in F 'doth' (found only in
                F3-4 for Q1-2, F1-2
              'dost'). G-C, curiously, reads 'doth'; see III.i (opening).165 s.d.-l67 Enter Peaseblossome . . . Tita. Be kind] Hand I here makes four
              additions, the exact order of which is difficult to determine: (1) crossing through F
              165 s.d. ('Enter Peaseblossome . . . four Fairies.') and 166 ('Fair.
              Ready: and I . . . we go?') and intending to begin Act III with Titania's speech
              (166-177) (influenced by Titania's earlier 'therefore goe with me' [159] and the
              omission in F1-4 of 165 in which she summons Peaseblossom, Cobweb,
              etc.), he inserts, following 164, 'Come follow me / my dear Exit:' (later crossed
              through); (2) he adds, in bottom right margin below the deleted F 165 s.d. and 166,
              'Bot: I am afraid [the last three words inserted above a deleted Who knows
              but] she may have a / mind to ravish me when she has discoverd / &lt;my&gt; parts why
              shoud I be a skittish nice Asse' (the last line shaved in binding and no exit
              direction, if there once was one, visible); (3) he adds, in a bold hand, across the
              top margin of the following F page (153), 'Actus 3us. Scen. 1&lt;a&gt; Titania &amp; Bottom, [if anything followed
              'Bottom,' it has been shaved away] / Enter [written over 'Pease']
              Peaseblossome, Cobweb, Moth, Mustardseed &amp; 4 fairies.' (the act-scene notation and
              s.d. appear to have been crossed through; if a scene setting prefaced the act- scene
              notation it has been shaved off); and (4) he adds, above 167, deleting the F
              speech-prefix 'Tita.' (167), 'Tit: You subject faires [sic] of /
                ye noblest Race', and continues with F 167 ('Be kind . . .
              Gentleman.). Note that Hand I makes another 
              abandoned attempt to begin Act III at what in modern texts is III.ii (see III.ii
              (opening)). Although Hand I eventually returned to the F Act III break, the additional
              lines for Bottom and the second of the two added lines for Titania were apparently
              retained, the shaving of the last line of Bottom's added speech leaving it unclear
              whether it was originally intended to conclude the scene following Titania's added
              'Exit:' (in which case it was probably followed by Hand I's own 'Exit:' now lost), or
              whether it was intended to begin the new scene--more likely the former. In any case,
              with Hand I's deletion of his new act-scene-entry notation, there is now no entry
              given for Peaseblossom, etc. or the '4 fairies', the F s.d. at 165
              having been crossed through. None of the acting texts begins a new scene here;
                FQ reduces Peaseblossom, etc. to 'Enter 4
                Fairies.' (dropping all reference to them by name), adding 'Where are my Fairy
              Spirits?' to Titania's shortened and rewritten F speech before their entry at 165; the
              other acting texts that retain the scene (see III.i (opening)) treat Peaseblossom,
              etc. as the quivalent of the F 'four Fairies' (165 s.d.) (following Q1-2) and add 165 from Q1-2 (first restored by
              Theobald). Nursery PB cuts 108 s.d.-III.ii.40.Image of prompt-book page 153168 gambole before] Hand I deletes F 'and' before
              'gambole' and F 'in', substituting 'before', with carets, at end of 168. See III.i
              (opening).175 then] Hand I deletes F 'And' and substitutes 'then'
              in left margin. See III.i (opening).206 s.d. Exeunt all] Hand I adds this s.d., but leaves F

              is his second abandoned attempt to change the point at which Act III begins. There is
              a large cross mark to the left (compare III.i.78 s.d.). Whether the projected change
              here is earlier or later than that at III.i. 165 s.d.-167 is problematical. The scene
              setting for III.i ('ye fforrest') presumably continues here after
              the deletion of 'Grove / agen' above. Note that no change of scene setting seems to
              have been called for when Hand I thought of beginning Act III at III.i.165 s.d.,
              although that arrangement would also appear to call for a new setting. No new scene in
                FQ; Garrick begins III.i here, setting 'A Forrest.'; G-C PB, G-C
              begin IV.i here, settings 'another Wood O' (G-C PB) and 'The Wood.' (G-C).
              Pope is the first editor to mark a new scene. 20-23 As wild-Geese . . . skye :] Circled, with a cross on

              (entirely omitting 20-23, 27-30); Garrick reduces 
              1-40 to thirteen lines, referring to Bottom simply as a 'clown'; G-C PB cuts 18-19 ('.

              Gentleman (Bell) suggests cutting 1-34.24] Above this line, to left of running-title, some hand
              has placed two rectangles, with a horizontal line through the centre, crossed on each
              end; the first rectangle appears to contain the figures '670' and is followed by 'god'
              after the right-hand cross. Does this possibly suggest the date 1670?24 Strait] Hand I deletes F 'So' and substitutes, to the
              left, 'Strait'. See 20-23.27-30 Their sense . . . catch,] Circled and crossed
              through. See 20-23. In right margin, opposite 29 and down to 39, some hand (seemingly
              Hand I) has written and circled 'So / for' twice in right margin and placed a cross in
              right margin opposite end of 38. Meaning?36 wet] Hand I deletes F 'latcht' and inserts 'wet' above.

                into] Hand I first crossed through F 'Being o're shoes in' (whether 'in' was
              deleted then or later is not clear) and inserts 'coverd' above 'shoes'; he then
              deletes 'coverd' and writes 'coverd &lt;?wth&gt; [or
              &lt;in&gt;]' in right margin, with crosses preceding it and under F 'shoes in';
              finally, he deletes this and substitutes, above in right margin, with a cross, 'Staind
                &lt;?wth&gt;'. At some point Hand I also inserts 'yet', with a
              caret, above F 'plunge', and 'to', with a caret, above F 'in the'. FQ merely
              allows Demetrius and Hermia to walk across the stage and cuts 43-87; Garrick cuts 44-
              46, 48, 52 ('I'le . . .')-55, 62-81, 83-87 (substituting 'Here, brooding o'er my

              circling of 52-55, but marked 'Stet' by Hand I at beginning (with three small crosses)
              and 'Stet' at end of 56. See 48.58 murderd] Hand ?II converts second 'er' in F 'murderer'

              in F 'looks' (as in Q1-2) and converts F 'as' to '&amp;'. Rowe
              first restored Q1-2 'look' and emended F 'as' to 'and'; Capell
              first restored 'as'. Only Nursery PB, Garrick retain 60 (the latter reading as in
              Rowe).61 Shining] Hand I deletes F 'glimmering' and inserts
              'Shining' at end of 61, with a cue-cross under each. Only Nursery PB, Garrick retain
              61.63 shew] Hand I deletes F 'give' end inserts 'shew' above.

              I crosses through 'give his carkasse to my hounds.' in 64 and variously circles,
              brackets, and crosses through 65-87 (87 only crossed through and 87 s.d. 'Lie
                down.' left undeleted) and writes the above version of 64-87 in right margin
              ('see him . . . de&lt;spair&gt;' opposite 64-72; 'Sorrow . . . d&lt;own)&gt;' opposite
              82-86). Before deleting the whole of 65-87, Hand I had apparently intended to retain
              66-67 ('Hast . . . men.'), placing an 'Exit', later crossed through, after 'men.' in
              67, and 74-82 ('You spend . . . vein,'), altering, with interlineations, 80 to read
              'thus from thy hated presence I depart:' (crossing through F 'And' and 'part I') and
              82 to read 'in this despair' (crossing through F 'in this fierce vein', with a caret
              below); all these earlier changes are crossed through. See 48.Image of prompt-book page 15490 &lt;m&gt;istake] Hand I deletes F 'misprision' and
              substitutes '&lt;m&gt;istake' in left margin. FQ cuts 90-91; Garrick. G-C PB,

                &lt;ru&gt;les.] Hand I circles and crosses through 92-93, placing a cross
              before F 'Rob.' (not crossed through), and substitutes the lemma in left
              margin. See 90.107 fair] Hand I deletes F 'the', with a caret below, and
              writes 'fair' in left margin (the beginning of 'fair' ('fa') has been deleted above F
              'the'). FQ substitutes 'yonder' for F 'the'.120] To the right of this line, Hand I has written what
              appears  to be 'That did here [or love]',
              underlined and crossed through. The reference of the deleted words is not clear, since
              they seem to have no relation to the context at 120 or at 180, the line following them
              in column two of F (p. 154). They may have had some connection with the aborted
              designation of IV.i as beginning with 121 s.d. (see next note).121 s.d. &lt;Act&gt; 4us Scen ja [crossed through]] Hand I at one point decided
              to begin Act IV with the entry of Lysander and Helena here, placing the act-scene
              notation above and to the left; he then changed his mind and shifted it to follow 344
              (see note on 344 s.d.). FQ begins Act IV with 102; Nursery PB, Garrick, G-C
              PB, G-C continue the scene as in F.122-127 Why do you think I follow you in scorn? / Scorn cannot
                well be masqud in sighs &amp; teares: / See while I vow I weep, and vowes so born, /
                like truth her selfe in / her first / dresse / appeares] Hand I, in 122,
              crosses through F 'should', 'that', and 'should wooe', substituting 'do' above
              'should' and 'follow you', with a caret, above 'should wooe'; in 123, he crosses
              through F 'and derision never comes in', substituting, with carets, 'cannot well be
              masqud in sighs &amp;' above; in 124, he crosses through F 'Look', substituting 'See'
              in left margin and altering 'en' in F 'when' to 'ile'; he then crosses through 125-127
              ('In their . . . true.'), substituting, following 125, with small crosses at beginning
              and end of F line, 'like truth her selfe in / her first / dresse / appeares'. Nursery
              PB cuts 128-129, 139-144, 149- 154, 157-161; FQ cuts 124-125, 130 ('Will . .
              .')-133, rewrites 139 ('O how . . .')-44 (adding two original lines after 144), and
              cuts 147-148, 157-176; Garrick cuts 124-129, 130 ('Will. . .')-136, 140-148, 151-162,
              163 ('this. . .')-164 ('. . . will,'), 166, 173-176; G-C PB cuts 126-127, 129, 130
              ('Will . . . )-133 (substituting 'give 'em not to me'), 141-144, 147-150 (substituting
              'mirth—poor Me!' for F 'merriment' in 146), 153- 154 (substituting 'simple Woman
              thus?' for F 'gentle Lady so?' in 152), 158 (substituting 'In my poor Eyes to conjure
              up the tears'), 159 ('none . . .')-161 (substituting '`tis unkindly done!'), 167 ('and
              . . .')-168 (substituting 'to death to death Demetrius / Hel: What cruel mocking of a
              simple maid!'), 171 ('to . . . sojourn'd,'; substituting 'to Hermia was but as a
              Guest'), 175 ('abide it dear'; substituting 'repent Lysander'), 176 ('yonder is my
              dear.') [Note that, beginning with the last part of 176, G-C PB at one time cut
              everything through 335 ('Now she holds me not,'); then some passages were marked
              'stet' and included in G-C.]; G-C generally follows G-C PB, but with the following
              differences: cuts 139-144, 145 ('O hell! . . .')-154 (substituting only 'simple
               woman thus!'), 156-157, 167 ('and . . .')-168
              (omitting one 'to death' in G-C PB's substitution), 170-171 (reading 172 as 'My heart

              in left margin, is so badly shaved as to be partly illegible and unintelligible;
              128-135 ('You doe . . . o're.') circled and crossed through, though originally only 'O
              devilish holy fray!' (130) was cut in 129-131 ('You . . . Hermiaes.'), F
              'doe' (129) having 'but' (Hand I) substituted above. Hand I's marginal substitution is
              cued with a crossed circle before F 'Hel.' (129); it was probably also cued
              with another crossed circle, mostly shaved off, before Hand I's 'Appear' in lemma
              above. See 122-127.136 and he . . . you. Awake] Crossed through.
              Hand I originally crossed through only F 'and he', inserting 'but' above F 'and',
              superposing 'I' on F 'he', and converting F s.d. 'Awa.' to 'Awake'.
              Hand I repeats '&lt;(a&gt;wakes)', in left margin opposite , followed by a cross. See

                thee] Hand I's addition, in left margin, is so badly shaved as to be partly
              illegible and unintelligible; 138-148 ('To what . . . injury.') circled in three
              stages ('To what' in 138 separately crossed through, not circled); originally Hand I
              intended to keep F 'To what' in 138 (and perhaps 143-144 ('O let . . . blisse.')) and
              made a marginal addition, keyed with a cross after F 'what' (138), above the present
              lemma, but crossed it through (only a few words are legible: 'my [or thy]',
              '?form', 'thy', '&lt;?crys&gt;toline', 'me on', 'and ?thus', 'my blisse'). See

              mostly original addition, placed in top left and left margin of F p. 156, is badly
              shaved and only partly legible or intelligible. The position of Hand I's addition,
              intended to replace 256-343 ('Dem. Quick, come.... run away.' [F s.d.
                'Exeunt.' at 343 being retained]), is noted by Hand I, to left of 256-257
              (F p. 155), with the words 'that / over the / leafe / comes in / here'. Earlier Hand I
              had inserted, following 256, 'Exeunt ye Men)', then deleted it,
              repeating it as part of his final addition. Helena's exit is presumably meant to be
              taken care of by F 'Exeunt.' (343). Nursery PB cuts 247-317, 325-335;

              deleted F 'wend', crossing through 373 and placing a cross at each end of 373
              (probably another cue-cross has been shaved off before '&lt;&amp; w&gt;th' in left margin). Hand I's 'former', inserted, with a caret, after 'their',
              takes the place of another deleted word before 'passions', of which only a final 'd'
              remains legible (probably 'old'). G-C reduces 372-374 to 'And back the lovers shall
              return in truth;'. See 356-357.377 all shall be at peace.] Hand I deletes F 'things' and

              gives the remainder of Puck's lines in this scene to Oberon.396-400 Up and . . . one.] PB has a cross opposite these
              lines in right margin. Garrick, G-C PB, G-C treat 396-399 as a song (sung by Oberon in

              exits no one, after 395, until 412; G-C exits Oberon and Demetrius (the last not
              having entered) and gives no re-entry for Oberon, cutting 404-412.406 Speak in what bush: thou hidest thy coward head?]
              Hand I deletes F 'some', inserting 'what' above, crosses through F 'Where cost thou',
              substituting 'thou' above (but forgetting to delete F colon after 'bush'), alters F
              'hide' to 'hidest' by inserting 'st', with a caret, above, and inserts 'coward', with
              a caret, above F 'thy head?'. See 404 s.d.407 s.d. Ent Rob.] Hand I places 'Ent' before F

              substitutes 'boy' following 409; he then crosses through F 'He is . . . thee.'
              (410-411) and substitutes, to right of 410-411, 'tis such a toy / yt shoud chastise thee' (with equals signs after F 'rod' and before 'tis'). G-C
              PB also reads 'Boy' for F 'child'. See 404 s.d.411 oh, art] Hand I substitutes 'oh', above and to left
              of, his deletion of F 'Yea', which he had originally altered to 'Yes' by writing 's'
              over 'a'. See 404 s.d.417 But I am faln in dark] Hand I crosses through F 'That
              faln am', writing 'But' above F 'am', and inserts 'am faln', with a caret, above F 'in

              through 418 ('Come . . . day:') and circles 419-420 ('For if . . . spight.', with a
              little crossing through in 420); he places a cross above F 'day:' (418), cued to a
              cross at the original beginning of the lemma, which first began with 'fortune but /'
              (crossed through), the whole lemma being squeezed into left of F centre-rule.
              Obviously, 'Come thou gentle day:' (418) should not have been deleted, since it is
              required to make sense of 'thy light' in Hand I's reworking of 419-420. FQ
              reads 419-420 as 'And wait with patience the approach of day, / Then if I meet him, we
              will end our Fray.'; G-C PB reads 418-420 as 'Come thou gentle Morning / For if but
              once thou shew thy twilight gray, / I'll find Demetrius, and revenge my

              above F 'me,' deletes 'ing' in F 'shifting' (appears to have altered 'ing' to 'st'
              originally, which is what is called for), and deletes F 'every', placing 'thy' above.
                FQ, G-C PB cut F 'For well I wot,' (422); for Garrick, see 417.425 Come thou hither,] Hand II (following Pope) inserts

              down)' following F 'visited.'. FQ adds s.d. 'Sleeps.', rewriting
              429-430; G-C PB, G-C give s.d. 'Lies down.' (following Rowe) after 429,
              cutting 430; Gentleman (Bell) places s.d. 'lies down.' after 429 and s.d.
                'sleeps.' after 430 (following Capell).433-434 That I may back return by morning light / freed from /
                those evills / yt I most / detest] Hand I crosses through
              F 'to Athens by day-light,' (433) and substitutes, following end of 433,
              'return by morning light' ('light' added, with a caret, above); he then crosses
              through 434 ('From these . . . detest,'; 'detest' being separately deleted), places a
              cross at each end of 434, and substitutes, left of centre-rule and preceded by another
              cross, 'freed from / those evills / yt I most / detest'. FQ rewrites 431-433 as 'Oh weary, tedious Night abate thy Hours; / Shine from
              the East that I may fly to Town,'.437 Yet but three here?] Hand II (following Hanmer)
              inserts, with a caret, 'here' above F 'three'. FQ reads 'There's yet but
              three,'.438 makes] Hand ?I adds 's' after 'e' in F 'make' (the
              reading of Q1-2, F1-2, F4). FQ, G-C PB, G-C, Gentleman (Bell) (the last three following Pope)
              read 'make'. The change in PB is surprising.442 When shall I see an end of all my woe,] Hand I
              crosses through F 'Never so . . . woe' and substitutes the lemma above. FQ
              rewrites 442 as 'Never was Maid so weary, and so wrong'd,'.445 s.d. desires. lies down)] Hand I inserts 'lies down)'
              following F 'desires.' See 430 s.d.446-447 Here will . . . fray.] Circled. FQ

                Lysander, if they meet and fight.'; for Garrick, see 417; G-C PB brackets
              442-447 and notes 'this may be sung'; G-C cuts 443,445.450-451 apply vnto your eye] Hand I inserts, above,
              'vnto' after F 'apply'. Some emendation is needed (Q1-2, F1-4 read 'apply your eye'). Nursery PB makes no correction;
                FQ (followed by Rowe, G-C PB, G-C) reads 'to your', but transfers 448-463
              to follow IV.i.107; for Garrick, see 417.453-454 wak'st, strait thou tak'st] Hand I inserts above,
              with a caret, 'strait' after F 'wak'st,' and alters 'r' in F 'rak'st' (an error in
                F2-3) to 't'; Hand I repeats 'strait' following 'tak'st'.
                FQ reads 'wak'st, then thou tak'st'; for Garrick, see 417; G-C PB, 'wak'st
              next, thou tak'st' (following Hanmer); G-C cuts 453-457. Note that Nursery PB, which
              makes no change in 453-454, lacks everything after 457, the remaining pages of text
              being supplied from another (unmarked) copy of F1.455 delight, in] Some hand has inserted a comma after F

              s.d. 'They sleep all the Act.' and substitutes, to left, the lemma (cf.
              IV.i.106 s.d. in F). Other acting texts also leave the lovers sleeping, though the
              mechanics of this are not at all clear in Garrick.

              s.d.); he thus continues the scene as in Q1-2. FQ
              continues the  scene, but cuts 1-64 (1-2, 30-32,
              rewritten, being transferred to follow III.ii.101), with rewriting of 65-66; Garrick
              begins 'SCENE VII' (of his Act III), but cuts 1-80; G-C PB deletes 'ACT IV.SCENE
              I.'and marks as 'Scene 10. The Wood.' (setting from 1734 ed.); G-C designates

              'thee'. Hand I's (if it is Hand I's) deletion does not improve the line metrically;
              Hanmer, for example, suggested 'fetch thee thence new nuts.'. See IV.i (opening).45 Sleep then] Hand I alters 'ou' in F 'thou' to 'en'. See

              . . eyes,') and substitutes the lemma to right of 52- 55 with an equals sign after F
              'pity.' (52). FQ substitutes for 51-66 'Thou hast perform'd exactly each
              Command. / Titania too has given me the sweet Boy.'; for Garrick, see IV.i

              inserts 'figure' following. FQ reads 69-70 as 'And gentle Puck, take thou the
              Asses Head, / From the transform'd Clown she doated on.'; for Garrick, see IV.i
              (opening).76 See thou as] Hand ?II inserts 'thou',
              with a caret, above F 'as' to balance F 'Be thou as' in 75. If this
              is Hand II's work, it is unlike his usual emendations, which are drawn from
              eighteenth-century edited texts through Hanmer. FQ in 77 reads 'Cinthia's'
              for F 'Dians'; G-C reduces 77-78 to 'As I to you, be you to me.'. For
              Garrick, see IV.i (opening).80 awake my Queen.] Hand I crosses through F 'you my

              Hand I crosses through F 'thou awak'st' (leaving F comma), inserting 'wakd thou'
              above, and inserts 'maist', in right margin, following F 'eyes'; F 'with' may have
              been accidentally crossed through. FQ reads 89 as 'So, when thou wak'st with
              thy own Fools Eyes, peep. [He takes off the Ass's Head.'; Garrick cuts
              89.90 come my fair Queen] Hand I crosses through F 'Sound

              'midnight,'. See 90.95 all far posterity] Hand II (following Hanmer) deletes
              'i' in F 'fair'. See 90.97 Theseus, in solemnity] Hand I crosses through
              F 'all in jollity' and, following, substitutes 'in solemnity'. See 90.Image of prompt-book page 158107 s.d. fforrest] Hand I inserts 'fforrest' above F s.d.
                'Enter Theseus . . . train.', thus simply continuing the scene (see
              III.ii.344 s.d. and IV.i (opening)). FQ begins Act V here (with no indication
              of change of scene); Garrick begins his III.viii here; G-C PB, G-C continue the scene
              but introduce Bottom's lines (205-225) before 108; Gentleman (Bell) continues the
              scene.109-110 For now . . . day,] Bracketed and crossed
              through. FQ cuts 109-110, 112 ('let them go;')-120; Garrick, 113 ('and finde

              Queen', inserting above, with a caret, 'ascend' ('ascend', with a caret, repeated in
              left margin opposite 114), and crosses through F 'And mark . . . confusion',
              substituting '&lt;and [or perhaps &amp;]&gt; lissen to the / &lt;plea&gt;sing
              harmony' in left margin. The sudden introduction of Philostrate (as 'Philostr/ =ates';
              cf. I.i.11) is surprising. He is mentioned as a character in I.i.11, but his lines in
                Q1-2 in V.i (except 76-81) are assigned to Egeus in F1-4 and are not reassigned to Philostrate(s) in PB. See 109-110.117-132 Hip. I was . . . hear.] Circled. See

              calls for 'A Composition in imitation of Hunting,': Garrick, G-C introduce a
               four-line song at 143; G-C PB (143) notes 'here
              might be introduc'd / a Hunting Song.'.133 this seems to be my daughter, here asleep,] Hand I
              crosses through F 'My Lord' before F 'this', deletes F 'is', substituting above, with
              a caret, 'seems to be', and inserts a comma after F 'daughter'.135 This Helena, ye long lost
                Hellena] Hand I crosses through F 'old Nedars Helena' and
              substitutes, following, 'ye long lost Hellena' cued with two
              equals signs. FQ cuts F 'old Nedars Helena'; Garrick cuts 135.136 I wonder at ther being] Hand I crosses through F 'of
              this' ('of their' Q1) and, above, inserts 'at ther' (so Pope,
              followed by Garrick, G-C PB, G-C); FQ reduces 136 to 'how came they here
              together?'.145 &lt;?How is i&gt;t you but / &lt;begi&gt;n] Hand I
              crosses through F 'Begin these wood-birds but' (with a small crossed circle above 'B')
              and inserts the lemma in left margin. FQ reads 145 as 'How came these
              Wood-birds but to couple now?'.146 Pardon my Gracious Lord] Hand I deletes F 'Lord.'
              and substitutes, following, 'Gracious Lord'. FQ reads 'Pardon me, gracious
                Sir.'; Garrick cuts 146-147.146 I pray . . . up.] Crossed through. FQ reads
              'Stand up, Lysander.'; G-C cuts.147 mortall enemies.] Hand I deletes F 'Rivall', placing
              a small cross below, and inserts 'mortall' (cued with a small cross below) after F
              'enemies.'. See 146.150 fear no injury.] Hand I deletes F 'enmity,' and,
              following, inserts 'injury.'. FQ cuts F 'and fear . . . enmity,'; Garrick
              reads 'not fear enmity?'.151-155 I shall. . . is;] 151 crossed through; 152-155
              circled and crossed through. FQ rewrites 151-158; Garrick cuts 152 ('But as .
              . .')-155, substituting 'but, as I do think,' from F 154 ('But as I think').159 we have] Hand I deletes F you' and inserts we' above.
                FQ reads 'he owns'.161-162 stoln away, Demetrius / And so woud]
              Hand I crosses through F 'they would' (161) and F 'Thereby to' (162) and substitutes,
              above the last, 'And so woud'. FQ reads 162 as 'They meant to have defeated
              you, and me;'.163-164 You of . . . wife.] Bracketed and crossed
              through. FQ, G-C cut 164; Garrick, as in PB.166 purpose, hither] Some hand inserts a comma after F
              'purpose'.168 followed me. wth passion] Hand I
              crosses through F 'in fancy' before F 'followed' and inserts 'wth
              passion' after F 'me.'. FQ slightly rewrites 165-181, cutting 166, and
              reading 168 as 'Hither, the too kind Helen follow'd me:'; Garrick cuts
              165-174, 180-181; G-C, 166,171 ('Seems...')-173, 175; Gentleman (Bell) suggests
              cutting 177 ('To . . .')-181.169 know] Hand I deletes F 'wot' and inserts 'know,' with
              a caret, above. So FQ (with rewriting); see 168.171 (melted as the snow)] Crossed through. See 168.171-172 now, but the remembrance of an idle toy,] Hand I
              inserts a comma after F 'now', deletes F 'as', substituting 'but', with a caret,
              above, and deletes F 'gaude', inserting 'toy' above. FQ reads 172 as 'And now
              she seems but as an idle Toy,'. See 168.175 eyes] Hand I adds 's' to F 'eye,' (over the comma).
              See 168.177 I Was bethroth'd, ere I saw Hermia,] Hand I
              deletes F 'I' after F 'Was', replacing 'I' before 'Was', and alters 'ee' in F 'see' to
              'aw'. FQ reads 177 as 'I was (my Lord) / Betroth'd to her, e're I saw
                Hermia :'; Garrick, G-C PB, G-C (following Rowe3) read
              'Was I betrothed ere I Hermia saw;'.178-181 But like . . . it.] Crossed through. See 168.182 Fair Lovers . . . met;] Crossed through. FQ
              rewrites 182- 190 as seven lines; Garrick cuts 182-183, 189-190; G-C reverses 182, 183
              and cuts 191, concluding the play here with a song by Lysander and a final chorus.184 Egæus, I must over-rule in this] Hand
              I deletes F 'will', substituting 'must' above, with a caret, and crosses through F
              'bear your will;', inserting 'rule in this' following F 'will;'. FQ reads 184
              as 'Egeus, I must over-rule your will;'. See 182.187 cause] Hand I deletes F 'for' and substitutes
              'cause'. with a caret, above. See 182.189-190 three and . . . solemnity.] Crossed through. See
              182.191 Come my Hippolita.] Hand ?II (following
              Hanmer) inserts 'my', with a half-caret, above F 'Come'. The ink here, however,
              suggests that 'my' is possibly Hand I's independent insertion. G-C PB, following 191,
              notes 'Here / a Song / of Joy &amp; / Love among / ye four /
              Characters'.193 Like Hills far of retiring into Clouds.] Hand I
              crosses through F 'far off mountains turned', with a caret after 'turned', and
              substitutes 'Hills' above 'far off', cued with an equals sign to 'far of retiring'
              (Hand I), also preceded by an equals sign, following F 'Clouds.'. FQ reads
              193 as 'Like Mountains far, far off, turn'd into Clouds.'; Garrick concludes the play
              here with a song by Helena, a four line speech by Theseus (including V.i.376- 377),
              and a chorus.194 things as / scarce awake] Hand I crosses through F
              'with  parted eye,' and substitutes 'as / scarce
              awake' following 'eye,', cued with equals signs after F 'things' and before 'as'.195-196 tis so wth me too / for] Hand
              I crosses through F 'So methinks:', substituting 'tis so wth me
              too' following, and deletes F 'And' (196), inserting 'for' above. FQ reads 'I
              think so too: / And'.199 That we still sleep] Hand I inserts, with a caret,
              'still' above F 'we sleep' (Q1-2, F1-2 read
              'That yet we sleepe'; first restored by Rowe). FQ cuts 89-191 ('. . .

              his 1816 adaptation also places the Pyramus and Thisbe play earlier in the woods,

              by oversight Hand I failed to change F 'in' to 'on' (as does Rowe).32 Come, Now,] Hand I inserts a comma after F 'Come' and

              substitutes the lemma, cued with another small crossed circle, after F 'rife:'. Hand

              crossing through 59, Hand I had deleted F 'strange' and inserted 'warm' above. This is
              as satisfactory an emendation as any later proposed (see Furness, New
                Variorum, pp. 206-207). See 25-27.61,63 lines] Hand I deletes F 'words' in 61 and 63 and

              'unbreathed', substituting, with a caret, 'shallow' following F 'memories', and
              crosses through F 'With this same Play,' (75), F 'against' (75) being partly crossed
              through in error.Image of prompt-book page 16076-81 Phil. No, my . . . play.] Circled, second
              half of 81 crossed through. F 'No' (76) seems to have been deleted before Hand I

              85-105 ('Hip. I love . . . capacity.') in two stages (85-89, 90-105). The

              be deleted, probably only by an ink show-through from F p. 159. 'Ege.' is not
              replaced by another speech-prefix and Egeus is the most obvious character to speak
              106, even though no re-entry is marked for him after his exit (by Hand I) at 84.112 we come; but] Hand ?II inserts a semicolon after F
              'come',  a unique pointing. FQ repoints
              108-117, destroying the intention behind the original mispointing; G-C PB cuts
              112-115.113 come, as] Hand ?II inserts a comma after F 'come (so

              after F 'not', inserting 'how to', with a caret, above (Hand I deletes an earlier,
              illegible insertion following 'to') and inserts 'him', with a caret, above, following
              F 'stop.' (the caret over F period). FQ reads 'he knows no stop:' (all
              comments on the Pyramus and Thisbe play in FQ (see 25-27) come from Robin
              (Puck), who is the only spectator).120-121 A good . . . true.] Crossed through. FQ
              cuts F 'A good morall my Lord.'123 &lt;lear&gt;ner [or &lt;begin&gt;ner] on / &lt;the
                f&gt;lajolet] Hand I originally deleted F 'child' and inserted 'boy' above;
              he then deleted 'boy' and crossed through F 'on the Recorder', substituting the lemma
              in left margin. FQ cuts 122-155.127 s.d. Tawyer with . . . them.] Crossed
              through. See 123.143 she let fall;] Hand ?I deletes F 'did' after F 'she'
              and substitutes 'let' following F 'fall;'. Since this is Pope's reading, 'let' may be
              Hand II's, but the 'e' is a secretary 'e', not elsewhere used by Hand II.154 why not] Hand I partly crosses through F 'no wonder'
              and, with a caret, substitutes 'why not' above.169 discourse] Hand I deletes final 'd' in F 'discoursed'
              (restoring Q1-2, F1-2 reading) and crosses
              through F 'my Lord' following. FQ reads 168-169 as '`Tis the wittiest
              Partition I ever saw.'.170 near the Apartmt] Hand I deletes
              F 'Wall' and inserts, with a caret, 'Apartmt' above. Apparently
                'Apartmt' is here used as a synonym for 'partition' (168); not
              in OED. FQ cuts 170.182 s.d. (kicks wall] Hand I inserts this s.d. following
              end of 182.183-184 should kick again.] Hand I deletes F 'curse' and

              in Hanmer) inserts a comma after F 'love' and deletes a comma after F 'art'.
                FQ reads 'My Love, thou art; my love,'.199 And I like] Hand ?I inserts 'I' above, with a caret,
              after F 'And' (the reading of Q1-2, F2,
                FQ, and Rowe).Image of prompt-book page 161203 not thy hole at all.] Hand I, with a caret after F
              'not', crosses  through F 'your lips' and inserts
              'thy hole' following F 'all.'. FQ reads 'thy Lips'.208-215 Dut: / This is the sil / liest stuffe / yt ere I hea / rd. / Duk / we must help / it by / imaginaton / then.]
              Hand I brackets and crosses through 208-215 ('Duk. Now is . . . them.') and
              inserts the first speech of the lemma in left margin opposite 207, cued by crossed
              circles above 'Dut:' and before F 'Duk.' (208); he then inserts the second
              speech of the lemma in left margin opposite 213, cued by a cross after F
              'Duk.' (213), presumably to another before 'Duk' (now shaved in binding).
              Before 208-215 were cut as a block, Hand I had inserted 'Hip' before F 'Dut.'
              (212), a line he then repeated in the first speech of the lemma. FQ cuts
              208-211; G-C PB, 208-211.216 imagination &amp; not theirs.] Hand I crosses through
              F 'then, and' and inserts '&amp;' above (the reading '&amp;' is uncertain).220-221 beasts, a Man and a Lion. in one] Hand I deletes
              F 'in' after F 'beasts,' and inserts 'in one' following F 'Lion.'. An interesting
              emendation of a crux, which, however, ignores the joint entry of Moonshine along with
              Lion. Rowe3 emended, surely correctly, by reading 'beasts in, a
              Man and a Lion.'. See 208-215.236-242 Dem. Not so . . . Moon.] Bracketed and
              crossed through. FQ cuts 230 ('and of . . .')-47; G-C PB, as in PB.252 the man i'th'Moon?] Hand I writes what looks like
              'but' after F 'Moon?' (the question mark more or less written over) and then deletes
              it. FQ cuts 250-260; G-C PB, 250-254.253-254 Dem. He dares . . . snuffe.] Crossed
              through. See 252.258 waine] Hand ?I inserts 'i', above, after 'a' in F

              this speech by Theseus following F 'Moon.'.265-266 Why all . . . Moon.] Crossed through, except for
              F 'in the Lanthorne:' (265). Since F speech-prefix 'Dem.' is not deleted, it
              is likely that Hand I intended Demetrius to speak the phrase. FQ cuts
              265-267.288 what staind] The ink blot over these words is a

              'hear'  to 'an' and deletes F 'Bergomask',
              substituting 'Antick' above. FQ cuts everything after 354 ('Adieu, adieu,
              adieu.') and substitutes, at end of Act V, a typically bawdy Restoration epilogue
              spoken by Oberon and Titania alternately.363 Never excuse it for] Hand I deletes F semicolon after
              'excuse'and inserts 'it above.364 none be blamed] Hand I deletes F 'to' after F
              'none'.366-367 have been] F 'been' appears to have been deleted,
              but is required for sense.368 performd] Hand I deletes F 'discharg'd' and inserts
              'performd' above.368-369 Antick] Hand I deletes F 'Bergomask' (cf.
              360-361) and inserts 'Antick' above.369 s.d. alone. (dance here)] Hand I inserts '(dance

              what remains of Hand I's final version of 370-377 ('The iron . . . jollity.'), which
              are circled and crossed through (370-371 separately and marked 'stat', though these
              lines were later adapted in the lemma). 'Duk:', preceded by a crossed circle, was
              inserted following 370 and was intended originally to cue to an earlier version of
              Hand I's lemma written in left margin opposite 369-377 and then so heavily crossed
              through that only a few scattered words are legible ('dance' [twice?],
              'i&lt;r&gt;on / &lt;tong&gt;ue of', '?be told'); the lemma is divided: &lt;'?ye ir&gt;on . . . fri = / = ght' inserted in left margin opposite

              in left margin opposite 378-379 below Hand I's deleted insertion. G-C PB cuts
              everything after 377, placing 'Ends.' below and calling for 'Chorus' (cf. I i
              (opening)).378 Lion roars] Hand ?II deletes 's' in F 'Lions'
              (following Rowe).379 behowls] Hand II underlines F 'beholds' and inserts
              (following Warburton) 'behowls' after F 'Moon:'.381 outworn] Hand I deletes F 'fore-done.' and inserts
