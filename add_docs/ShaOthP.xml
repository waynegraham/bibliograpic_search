                            uncertain. See the Introduction, p. 2, for what is known or conjectured
                            about these actors. Presumably, the actors here named are to play the
                            characters entering at the beginning of scene iii. `&lt; &gt;oin' and
                            `&lt;W&gt;almsly' can be assigned as `1. Sen.' and `2.
                                Sen.' and probably Trefusis as the Officer (at 12). This
                            would seem to leave `&lt;Totterd&gt;ell' as the Duke, but such an
                            assignment for Totterdale at this point in his career would seem
                            unlikely. Clark (Early Irish Stage, 1955, p. 76) gives
                            Totterdale the role of an officer, but the order of the PB entry would
                            seem to support Trefusis' claim to that role. Perhaps, however, the
                            `&amp;c:'after Trefusis' name implies that he and others came on to
                            "swell the scene" as other Senators and Officers. Whether the mysterious
                            `&lt; &gt;ick' should be interpreted as the remains of an actor's name
                            is not at all certain. Under other circumstances I would propose
                            `&lt;mus&gt;ick', but there seems no reason to open scene iii with music
                            of any kind.79-82 [line] /Salor / Mr Barnes / [line]]

                            I can see no cause for questioning their identity. Palmer PB calls for

                            omits the Sailor's cry within (also 1764, Kemble) and gives his later

                            obviously a scene adapted from some other play and means that the

                            second entrance at 52, he must be supposed to exit at some point after

                            F, the Smock Alley PB lacks three leaves (pages 795-800, sigs. 3X5-3Y1),
                            beginning again on page 801 (sig. 3Y2) at (`I give . . . thee,').
                            Possible reasons for the loss of these leaves are discussed in the
                            Introduction, p. 7, note 21. It is difficult to assess the amount of
                            cutting, or other changes, made in PB. See the Introduction, pp. 7-8,
                            for further discussion. 18th-century acting texts and Kemble omit, among
                            other smaller cuts, II.i.125-145 (`Come . . . best.'), 229-253 (`When

                            (the clown scene), and III.ii (Othello giving letters to be sent to
                            Venice); in addition, Palmer PB cuts II.iii.1-11 (omitting the entrance
                            of Othello and Desdemona and bringing Cassio on at 11 with Iago) and,
                            1755 PB cuts II.i 94-96 (`Within.] A sail . . . news.').
                            Collier MS cuts about 83 lines in all, including II.i. 125-146 (`me?
                                Iago. I am . . . indeed?') and III.i.1-31. On the omission
                            of III.i, Gentleman (Bell) remarks: "Shakespeare has furnished,
                            at the beginning of the third act, a very trifling, non-essential scene,
                            of two pages, to gratify the peculiar taste of his audiencies
                                [sic], but which is now most justly rejected, the act
                            beginning much better here [i.e. III.iii]." Gentleman, however, objects
                            to the omission of II.iii. 205-207 (`My blood . . . way.'), commenting:
                            "We think, the following lines of the original should be retained, as

                            and crosses through ` 'st' in F `eccho'st' (the reading thus follows
                            Q2-3, Q (1681)). 1755, Bell read `why, by heav'n thou echo'st' (after
                            Pope); 1764 reads `by heav'n, thou echo'st'; Kemble reads `By heaven, he

                            addition implies the Q1-3 reading of the line, omitting the colon after
                            F `that'. 18th-century acting texts and Kemble adopt the Q1-3 reading
                            (first editorially inserted by Rowe). Hand II's emendation makes easier

                            be different from that in 287) crosses through F `Napkin:'and interlines
                            above, with a caret, `handkerchief'. The crossing through of `Napkin:'
                            may represent an original attempt (by Hand ?III) to convert `Napkin:'
                            into `kercher', thus reading `handkercher'. It may be noticed that Hand
                            II fails to alter `Napkin' in 321. Q1 alone among the early texts uses
                            `handkercher' for `handkerchief', first in 306-307. 1764 reads as in PB;
                            Bell reads `handkerchief here' (Hanmer first read `napkin here' and is

                            inherited from F2 (F1 reads `sense'); Hand ?III's reading as a whole
                            follows Q1-3,  Q (1681). 1764, Kemble read as in PB; 1755,

                            Iago,'; 1764 reads: `Thou had'st better been born a dog, a dog,

                            Q1-3, Q (1681); part of some lines lacking in Q1). 18th-century acting
                            texts and Kemble read as in PB (Pope first adopted the Q2 reading).393 May, and will.] Some hand has crossed
                            through F `I' following `and'. PB here would seem to anticipate Pope's
                            emendation of F1 (Q1-3, Q (1681) read: `nay, I will.'), which is adopted
                            by 18th-century acting texts; Kemble adopts the Q reading.422 [line] / Desdemon / Emilia ] Below 422, in

                                through]] The handling of these lines in PB presents
                            unusual complications. Originally the scene appears to have been planned
                            by Hand I to include lines 1-37, even keeping the role of the Clown (see
                            Hand I's call at III.iii.424-427, where `Clown' has been later crossed
                            through by ?Hand V). Then some other hand has marked, by circling, 1-37
                            for cutting, including the opening s.d., an arrangement that makes no
                            sense, as Hand I had recognized by calling for Othello's entrance at 31
                            (F [i.e., F3] wrongly enters Othello after 37). The next step seems to
                            be the deletion of 1-22, by crisscrossing, with a line added below 22.
                            The same hand then wrote `Cut out' (right of left rule opposite F
                            opening s.d.), and `Cut' (left of left rule opposite F 23), deleted (by
                            circling) F `and Clown.' in opening s.d., and crossed through F
                                `Exit Clo.' at 22. The scene thus begins with the entrance
                            of Desdemona and Emilia at 23, contrary to Hand I's original intention.
                            The identity of the hand here involved is uncertain (Hand ?VI), but it
                            is the same hand, presumably, that writes in `Enter 0th' to left of
                            center rule at 31. Hand VI places `Chamber/ Here', to left of center
                            rule, preceded by a crossed line opposite 24. At the same time Hand VI
                            deletes Hand II's `Chamber.', to left of center rule, below 38 and
                            following F `Enter Othello.' (also crossed through by Hand ?I).
                            Hand IV at some point in this process places `[line] / Stent / [line]',
                            to left of center rule, opposite 29. The final intentions are clear, but
                            the order in which the various notations were made is uncertain. 1755,
                            Bell give the setting as `an Apartment in the same Castle';
                            1764, as `another Apartment in the same Palace' 
                            (following Theobald); Kemble, as `Another Apartment in the
                                Castle'; Palmer PB adds below the 1755 setting `

                                Castle'. 18th-century acting texts cut the opening parts of
                            this scene heavily: 1755 cuts 26-29 (`. . . blab.'), 35-36 (`we say . .

                            Bell cuts as in 1764, except for the last cut, which in Bell is 35-210
                            (`lie on her? . . . no body.'). Gentleman (Bell) has two notes on the
                            beginning of Act IV: "It does Shakespeare great service to
                            begin the Fourth Act here, as the six original pages which precede, are
                            tedious, confused, trifling, and often indecent: the Moor has already
                            been sufficiently wrought on; besides, the character of
                            Othello, as it now stands, is as much as very great spirit and
                            acting powers can go through; more must sink the ablest performer." And:
                            "We think beginning the Act at this line [216] would save delicacy a
                            blush or two, and be, in that sense, an improvement." The first note is
                            attached to the beginning of the scene and is confusing, since Bell
                            begins with line 1 (see above for the cutting in Bell).1-2 [line] / Cassio / [line]] Hand I. Point of entrance marked with a crossed line at

                            This cut makes nonsense of F `nor answers' preceding the cut. Perhaps
                            the Q1-3, Q (1681) reading `nor answer haue I none' may have influenced
                            the PB reviser here. To make sense, however, the `s' on F `answers'
                            should have been deleted, thus making `answer' a verb parallel to F
                            `weep'. 1755, 1764, Kemble cut 103-104 (`I cannot . . . water.'); Palmer

                            was written above `&lt;la&gt;st'; perhaps the word is `the'. The
                            rationale for this prompt-note is not clear, unless it is a reminder
                            that apart from those actors already on stage and those entering at 282,
                            the other members of the company will no longer be needed.269-359] A tear in pages 815-816 from the
                            bottom, right, up through 269, has damaged the text toward the end of
                            the second column.272 oh ill-Starr'd wench,] Crossed through. Q1 omits

                            1755, 1770, Bell, Butters cut the last half of 276 (`O cursed, cursed
                            Slave!'). On 277-280, Gentleman (Bell) remarks: "Though the marked lines
                            afford a fine transition of expression, yet, as they convey very horrid
                            ideas, we could wish them omitted." Kemble did not take the hint.313 most heathenish, and most grosse.] Crossed
                            through. 18th-century acting texts and Kemble cut as in PB. Some hand,
                            however, suggests a larger cut by placing horizontal lines after 309 and
                            313 indicating a proposed cut of 310-313.348-351 Of one . . . gumme.] Partly

                            (360-371), is missing from PB; the verso of sig. 3Z4 is the first page
                            of Antony and Cleopatra . 1755, 1764 cut 357, 360-361 (`This .

                            Bell cuts 357-361 (`Oh bloudy . . . heart.') Kemble cuts 357-359 (`Oh
                            bloudy . . . kiss.'), adding `O, Desdemona!' after 356, 361-365 (`Oh
